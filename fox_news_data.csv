Mob of anti-Israel agitators arrested near top Senate Democrat's home,"incoming update…


Anti-Israel protesters gathered near the Brooklyn home of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., were arrested Tuesday night.
Police officers were seen placing zip ties on demonstrators at the scene.
The New York Police Department did not immediately have a figure on the number of arrests.
The protest came a day after more than 100 people were arrested at an NYU Gaza solidarity encampment on the college campus.
Schumer was asked about the protest during a Tuesday night press conference following the Senate's passage of a $95 billion foreign aid package for Israel and Ukraine.
He was asked by Fox News' Kelly Phares to share a message for protesters, to which he replied by referring to his statement earlier condemning antisemitism on Columbia University's campus.
“College campuses must be places of learning and discussion. Every American has a right to protest, but when protests shift to antisemitism, verbal abuse, intimidation, or glorification of Oct. 7 violence against Jewish people, that crosses the line. Campuses must remain safe for all students,"" Schumer's statement read.
When pressed again for a message to the protesters outside his home, he refused to answer.
Columbia University President Minouche Shafik set a deadline at midnight to reach an agreement in negotiations with student organizers involved in the “Gaza Solidarity Encampment.” Otherwise, there could be a consideration of “alternative options for clearing the West Lawn and restoring calm to campus so that students can complete the term and graduate.”
Shafik sent an email to the Columbia community shortly before 10 p.m. Tuesday night stating that members of groups from student organizers to members of faculty, administrators, and the University Senate “have been in dialogue” to “discuss the basis for dismantling the encampment, dispersing, and following university policies going forward.”
“I fully support the importance of free speech, respect the right to demonstrate, and recognize that many of the protestors have gathered peacefully,” Shafik wrote in her email. “However, the encampment raises serious safety concerns, disrupts campus life, and has created a tense and at times hostile environment for many members of our community. It is essential that we move forward with a plan to dismantle it.”
The university has already shifted to a hybrid learning environment amid safety concerns. This comes after Shafik on early Monday declared all classes that day would be online.
Tuesday's midnight deadline comes less than a week after Shafik authorized a police sweep of the encampment, resulting in 108 arrests. It was the largest mass arrest on campus since 1968.
“I also want to be clear that we will not tolerate intimidating, harassing, or discriminatory behavior,” Shafik said. “We are working to identify protestors who violated our policies against discrimination and harassment, and they will be put through appropriate disciplinary processes.”

FBI Director Christopher Wray, testifies during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing titled Oversight of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in Hart Building on Aug. 4, 2022.

FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau shares intelligence about certain threats of violence related to heated protests on college campuses.
“Demonstrations themselves are not something that we, the FBI, get involved in,” Wray told NBC News in an interview that aired Tuesday. “But when violence ensues, that’s when we get concerned.”
“Even before Oct.7, we saw a significant increase, especially in antisemitic threats and antisemitic violence,” he added. “And since Oct. 7, that number has gone up quite substantially.”
Protests on college campuses began after the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas but were revived last week after months of relative calm.
Hundreds of protesters have been arrested at Columbia and New York universities and school administrators have been criticized for not doing more to keep Jewish students safe.
Wray noted that the FBI doesn’t monitor protests, but does “share intelligence about specific threats of violence with campuses, with state and local law enforcement.”


The founder of a pro-Israel international campus movement is warning against history repeating itself as antisemitism continues to rage on university and college campuses across the country.
Ilan Sinelnikov, the president and founder of Students Supporting Israel (SSI), a pro-Israel student movement, told Fox News Digital that history is repeating itself — pointing to the recent anti-Israel protests on Columbia University's campus in New York City.
""History at the end of the day repeats itself,"" he said. ""What we have seen back in the 30s with the harassment and intimidation of Jewish people across Europe, back when Jewish students were not allowed to universities and people were creating human chains in order to block Jewish students from entry.""
""Jewish students are being intimidated and harassed on college campuses. I was on a call with a Jewish student that goes to Columbia University, and she said, 'I can't wait to pack my bags and get on the first flight home. I don't want to be on this campus anymore.'""
""When you get to the point, when in our most prestigious universities, 
Jewish students don't feel safe to walk on those campuses because they're afraid of being harassed or afraid of being physically assaulted,"" said Sinelnikov. ""When you see all of that, the similarities are frightening.""

House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., sent a scathing letter to top Biden officials about the ongoing anti-Israel protests at Columbia University, demanding federal intervention to protect Jewish students.
In a letter dated Tuesday, Stefanik wrote to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Attorney General Merrick Garland. The New York congresswoman did not mince words when describing the disarray caused by the anti-Israel protests at the New York City Ivy League institution, threatening Jewish students and faculty.
""Over the past few days, anarchy has engulfed the campus of Columbia University and created an environment that is unsafe for Jewish students and faculty,"" she wrote. ""You have the ability and authority to put a stop to this and take concrete steps to hold accountable those responsible.""
""Consequences are needed for those who are calling for terrorism and violent attacks,"" she added. Stefanik cited the Immigration and Nationality Act, which states that anyone who endorses terrorism can become ineligible for American residency, and noted that protesters are ""brazenly endorsing Hamas and other terrorist organizations.""
Classes at Columbia will be entirely virtual for the rest of the semester due to the protesters ""taking over"" the campus. New York City

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., speaks to the media during a press conference at the U.S. Capitol on March 01, 2023 in Washington, DC.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., decried the intimidation of Jewish students and antisemitic rhetoric on college campuses in New York City as “unacceptable and deeply disturbing.”
Anti-Israel protests have raged on the campuses of Columbia University and New York University in recent days, with students setting up encampments in an effort to force the schools to divest from Israel.
“Every American has the constitutional right to free speech and peaceful assembly in the public square,” Jeffries said in a statement. “However, intentionally targeting Jews or any community on the basis of race, religion or ethnicity, acts of harassment and the use of physical violence will never be tolerated.”
“No Jewish student or faculty member should fear for their safety on campus or anywhere else in our nation,” he added.
Columbia recently announced that classes would shift to virtual or hybrid learning as Jewish students have voiced concerns over antisemitic rhetoric by pro-Palestinian supporters.
“The effort to crush antisemitism and hatred in any form is not a Democratic or Republican issue,” said Jeffries. “It’s an American issue that should bind us all together. We will continue to do everything possible to protect the Jewish community during this very fraught moment, fight the cancer of antisemitism and redouble our efforts to bring communities together.”

Former President Trump slammed Columbia University for closing its campus amid violent anti-Israel, pro-Gaza protests, urging the college to ""gain a little strength"" and ""courage,"" while saying the move ""means the other side wins.""
Trump took reporter questions in Trump Tower on Tuesday evening before a meeting with former Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso, who is the current vice president of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party.
The former president and presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee was asked if he would visit with Jewish students this week amid protests, following the news that House Speaker Mike Johnson plans to visit Columbia University’s campus Wednesday.
""Well, we have a lot of different things, but what’s going on with the colleges—and, they’re closing Columbia now? I mean, it’s just crazy,"" Trump said. ""Columbia should gain a little strength, a little courage and keep their school open.""
""It’s crazy because that means the other side wins,"" Trump said. ""When you start closing down colleges and universities—that means the other side [wins.]""

A watchdog group that focuses on higher education released footage exposing the chaos occurring at the epicenter of the anti-Israel protests plaguing one of America's most prestigious Ivy League universities.
Adam Guillette, president of Accuracy In Media, visited Columbia University to speak with the people behind the anti-Israel protests that have erupted at the school, filming his encounters in a video shared with Fox News Digital.
Guillette, who is Jewish, received a cold welcome when he asked several protesters questions about Hamas, the safety of Jewish students on campus, and why they were demonstrating against Israel.
One person said students were not being threatened despite the Morningside main campus
 switching to hybrid or remote learning for the remainder of the spring semester due to safety concerns for Jewish students.
When asked who their favorite terrorist group was, one person said ""IDF"" (Israel Defense Forces).
Others cursed at Guillette or told him to ""shut up"" when asked if Hamas should remain in charge of ""Palestine."" Another person flipped off Guillette and told him to ""f--- off.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., will meet with Jewish students at Columbia University on Wednesday as anti-Israel protests continue to besiege the Ivy League campus.
Johnson will meet with an unspecified number of students at 3 p.m. in a private meeting.
The speaker has criticized protesters who have taken over parts of colleges campuses in recent days in an organized effort to force schools to divest from Israel and companies that do business with the Jewish state.
""Amid anti-Israel protests, Jewish students at Columbia University don't feel safe,"" Johnson wrote in a Tuesday social media post. ""It’s become so dangerous that students were forced out of the classroom. Let’s be clear: these are not peaceful protests, these are antisemitic mobs.""
After the meeting, Johnson will deliver some remarks and take questions ""regarding the troubling rise of virulent antisemitism on America’s college campuses,"" his office said.
An Orthodox rabbi at Columbia University and Barnard College recently sent a message recommending Jewish students leave campuses and go home as students continue to occupy an encampments there.
In a WhatsApp message sent to hundreds before the start of Passover, Rabbi Elie Buechler, director of OU-LJIC at Columbia/Barnard, told students to leave ""as soon as possible"" until the situation improves, noting that ""what we are witnessing in and around campus is terrible and tragic.""
""The events of the last few days, especially last night, have made it clear that Columbia University’s Public Safety and the NYPD cannot guarantee Jewish students’ safety in the face of extreme antisemitism and anarchy,"" Buechler wrote. ""It deeply pains me to say that I would strongly recommend you return home as soon as possible and remain home until the reality in and around campus has dramatically improved.""
As a result of the protests, Columbia instructed students that classes at the Morningside main campus have moved to hybrid learning ""until the end of each school’s Spring 2024 semester.""

Anti-Israel protests at Columbia University that led to fear for the safety of Jewish students have sparked growing calls for tuition refunds over the chaos.
Last week, the New York City Police Department arrested 108 demonstrators after they had set up an encampment on the campus lawn. Over the weekend, a Columbia University rabbi urged Jewish students to leave campus following instances of antisemitic harassment.
In response to the rabbi's message, commentator Bethany Mandel wrote on X, ""Jewish parents need to demand their tuition back. If their kids can’t be kept safe, Columbia owes them repayment.""
Then on Tuesday, students at the Ivy League institution were informed that classes have shifted to virtual or hybrid as concerns linger about campus safety stemming from the anti-Israel demonstrations.
One student, Michael D’Agostino told The New York Post the switch to hybrid classes is frustrating given ""the amount we pay to be at this school to learn from these amazing faculties and professors.""
The total cost of attending Columbia University is $89,587 per school year.
""I’m studying applied physics and applied math and those are classes I really benefit from being in-person,"" the D'Agostino told the outlet. ""I went through COVID and all that when we were online for about a year and it really disrupted our education.""

Mayor Eric Adams and New York Police Department top brass condemned ""outside agitators"" fanning the flames of anti-Israel protests at Columbia and New York University, as police made more arrests.
At his usual Tuesday press conference from City Hall, Adams, a Democrat and former police officer, praised the NYPD's response.
""We can't have outside agitators come in and be destructive to our city,"" Adams said. ""Someone wanted something to happen at that protest at NYU.""
""People who peacefully protest for an issue, they're not throwing bottles in chairs,"" the mayor added. ""And so we know that we have acknowledged and saw across the country, there are people who come have nothing to do with the issue and they want to aggravate. Now, if those police officers didn't show a high level of discipline, this could have been an ugly situation.""
The NYPD confirmed that 120 individuals were taken into custody by New York University on Monday, including 116 who were released with a summons for trespassing.
""What I learned during the Black Lives Matter protest, when I was notified under the previous administration that there were anarchists that came into the city with the determination of really disrupting and tearing our city apart,"" Adams said. ""We strongly believe that is the case right now, that there are people who are here. They latch on to any protests to see our police officers having bottles thrown at them, chairs.""

Amid the anti-Israel protests raging on college campuses, questions about who or what is behind the seemingly well-organized effort are being asked as many of the demonstrations look identical, from the message to the tents being used in student encampments.
Jonathan Schanzer, a senior vice president with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies research institute, said his group began watching a group known as the Students for Justice in Palestine a decade ago. The group has been a fixture at such protests in recent weeks.
“And what we found was that there was an organization, an umbrella organization known as AMP, American Muslims for Palestine,” Schanzer told “America Reports.” “It started with just a handful of campuses. There's now 200 campuses that have SJP. They use a lot of the same rhetoric. They use a lot of the same devices on campuses, the different means of protests.”
Much of the money being funneled to the SJP comes from an obfuscated money trail, including a nonprofit in White Plains, New York
 called Westpac, said Schanzer.
The goal is to put political pressure on the Biden administration, he said.
“I mean, the pressure was there for Trump, it was there for Obama,” Schanzer said. ”The idea is to wield that political pressure as much as possible. And we're seeing tactics that really do look like the 1960s revisited.”
“And you can see right now that the president is, is kind of having a bipolar moment as it comes to, the Israeli war effort
 in Gaza. On the one hand, we're now supporting, with additional funding, this very just war that the Israelis are fighting,” he added. “In the same time, they're talking about issuing sanctions or withholding certain funds from units that are operating in the IDF, the very same army that we're looking to fund here. The president is trying to figure out how to walk a fine line. I think the message is muddled right now. And I do wonder whether these campus agitators have a role.”

Police at the University of Minnesota cleared out an anti-Israel protest encampment from its Twin Cities campus, which is located in progressive ""Squad"" member Rep. Ilhan Omar’s district, and arrested nine demonstrators early Tuesday.
The university’s Department of Public Safety received reports that a group had set up an encampment with tents on the north end of the Northrop Mall, a university spokesperson told Fox News Digital.
Officers warned the protesters around 6 a.m. that those present were in violation of university policy and state trespassing law as tents are not allowed on campus without a permit, the spokesperson said, adding that ""no encampments, tents, fires, or other types of encampment living arrangements have ever been permitted on any university properties or in buildings.""
""The group was asked to disperse by 7 a.m. and told they would be arrested if they chose to stay past that time,"" the university spokesperson said. ""Some of those present chose to disperse and continue peacefully protesting, but nine chose to remain and were arrested without incident.""
Those arrested were taken on trespassing charges to the Hennepin County jail, where more than a dozen demonstrations gathered to protest the arrests, Minnesota Public Radio reported.

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., urged the New York Police Department to arrest anti-Israel protesters if they are breaking the law.
Authorities in New York have arrested protesters at various college campuses after they failed to disperse and began squatting on campus.
“These university presidents may need to ask the chief of police in New York and New York City’s finest to arrest anyone who’s breaking the law, who’s squatting on private property when they’ve been told to disperse, who’s harassing or intimidating Jewish students in a nascent pogrom and demand that students actually do what they’re supposed to do on campus, which is go to school,” Cotton told “America Reports” on Tuesday.
Cotton also urged the Biden administration to revoke any visas for foreign students who are breaking the law and to deport them.
“They have no right to be here. They certainly have no right to be here spewing antisemitic and anti-Israel filth,” he said.
Columbia University
 called the NYPD last week to clean an encampment, resulting in 108 arrests for trespassing. Protesters are demanding the school divest itself from all companies that do business with Israel.
Cotton compared the protests, in which demonstrators have called for the destruction of Israel and the United States, to scenes in 1930s Nazi Germany, which preceded the Holocaust.


The Israeli embassy in New York City tells Fox News Digital Tuesday that it is ""deeply troubled"" by the ""recent rise in anti-Semitic incidents"" unfolding at schools such as Columbia and New York University.
The Consulate General of Israel in New York said ""Such acts contravene free speech principles and have no place in academia.""
""We are deeply troubled and strongly condemn the recent rise in anti-Semitic incidents at institutions such as Columbia University and NYU, where Jewish, Israeli, and pro-Israeli students are targeted and denied a safe educational environment,"" it said.
""These manifestations of hate are unacceptable. Institutional leaders must urgently address and correct these behaviors,"" the consulate added. ""Recent events have been overlooked for too long without significant intervention, which is now crucial than ever for the safety and well-being of all students.""

New York University appears to be tightening security on campus after more than 100 anti-Israel agitators were arrested during Monday night's protest.
Plywood barricades were installed at Gould Plaza, where a day earlier students and faculty had encamped and demanded that the school divest from Israel. Dozens were cited for trespassing and four face criminal charges after police were called to the scene to restore order. All have been released with summons to appear in court on disorderly conduct charges.
Antisemitism has surged on Ivy League campuses as students and outside protesters have put on demonstrations protesting the war in Gaza. Protesters carried pro-Hamas signs and chanted antisemitic slogans at NYU and Columbia University, accusing Israel of genocide against Palestinians for its response to the Oct. 7 terror attack, in which Hamas infiltrated the Jewish state and slaughtered 1,200 Israelis.
University spokesperson John Beckman said NYU was carrying on with classes Tuesday.

Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., on Tuesday called for Columbia University President Minouche Shafik to get the anti-Israel agitators on campus under control or resign.
In a statement, Torres said the decision to cancel in-person classes was a choice ""to surrender control of Columbia to an antisemitic fringe.""
""If you cannot ensure the safety of your students, then you have no business serving as President of any university, let alone the alma mater of Alexander Hamilton,"" Torres said.
“What Columbia University needs is not an appeaser of antisemitism but a leader who will fight with moral clarity against it. College administrators should start defending their Jewish constituents and students and stop pandering to the antisemites who seek their destruction. Appeasing antisemitism never works,"" he continued.
""That Columbia University has failed its Jewish students so profoundly is an indelible stain on the soul of the institution. If the President of Columbia University cannot lead with moral clarity, then she should step aside for a true leader who can and will.”


Anti-Israel protesters at New York University walked out of class on Tuesday and gathered at Washington Square Park in New York City.
A large crowd of people carrying signs were seen in the park, where a speaker with a bullhorn led a call and response from those gathered. The crowd chanted, ""free, free Palestine!"" and other slogans.
Hours earlier, more than 100 were arrested by NYPD for trespassing on NYU's campus after police were called to the scene to disperse the unruly crowd.
NYPD sources police used zip ties and flex cuffs to remove the protesters from campus. They were taken on a bus to police headquarters, where they were charged with trespassing, the sources said.
Some of the protesters at Monday night's demonstration were filmed hurling bottles at police.
""When NYU asked the NYPD to clear Gould Plaza of individuals who were refusing to disperse and were ‘interfering with the safety and security of our community,’ our officers moved in without delay,"" NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Operations Kaz Daughtry posted on X.
""Unfortunately, as they were dispersing the crowd, some chose violence and pelted the police with bottles,"" Daughtry said. ""The professionalism and composure our officers showed as they cleared the plaza — despite these dangerous acts of aggression they encountered — are to be commended.""

The open antisemitism running rampant on Columbia University's campus in New York City has drawn condemnation from both sides of the aisle, but one prominent Democrat and alumnus of the school is remaining silent, choosing not to speak out against the anti-Israel demonstrations taking place there.
In a lengthy Monday post on X commemorating the celebration of Passover, former President Obama, who graduated from Columbia in 1983, made no mention of protestors' violent rhetoric aimed at the university's Jewish students and staff, and neither he nor his representatives responded to Fox News Digital's request for comment about the antisemitic demonstrations that have engulfed the campus since last week.
A number of other Democrats have, however, joined their Republican colleagues in denouncing discrimination against Jews at Columbia, which was forced to move all classes to virtual on Tuesday because of safety concerns.
""Every American has a right to protest,"" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement. ""But when protests shift to antisemitism, verbal abuse, intimidation, or glorification of Oct. 7 violence against Jewish people, that crosses the line.""
New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, another Democrat, also denounced the display of antisemitism at the university, saying she was ""appalled.""
""Threats of violence against Jewish students and the Jewish community are horrible, despicable and wholly unacceptable,"" she said. ""Using the rhetoric of terrorists has no place in New York, where we pride ourselves on tolerance and the right of every group to practice their religion in peace.""
Others who joined their party members in addressing the encampment were Sens. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., and John Fetterman, D-Penn.

Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., spoke out Tuesday about his experience visiting the anti-Israel student protests at Columbia University.
Those protests have spread to multiple Ivy League and elite campuses across the U.S. and have resulted in hundreds of arrests.
""It has created a place that does not feel safe for all students from all backgrounds and races and religions, and the bottom line is that is completely unacceptable at any college campus,"" Gottheimer said on CNN's ""This Morning.""
Gottheimer said he came to Columbia in support of an educational experience that is safe and welcoming for all students.
""No antisemitism, no Islamophobia, no attacks on anybody,"" he said, endorsing ""civil and constructive discourse.""
When asked if he would feel safe sending his children to Columbia University after what he witnessed on campus, Gottheimer said he would be concerned about their well-being.
""After what I saw yesterday? I would be very concerned,"" he said. ""And I understand why parents would be very concerned.""
""Imagine sending your child off to college and obviously spending a pretty penny for it and they‘re not safe and you're worried if they‘re going to be safe,"" he said.
""I think that‘s unacceptable,"" Gottheimer continued, ""that they can‘t even feel safe on the campus, and I think that it echoes a huge responsibility now that many of my colleagues are calling for, that these university presidents across the country step up and provide a safe space for all students.""

A group called the NYU Palestine Solidarity Coalition is calling on students at New York University to walk out of classes Tuesday following violent anti-Israel protests that unfolded there last night.
The group has posted on Instagram for students to walk out of class at 1 p.m. ET and head to Washington Square Park in Manhattan ""to reflect, debrief [and] strategize.""
Anti-Israel protests at New York University's campus turned violent Monday night when demonstrators hurled bottles at police officers who were sent to the scene to disperse a large unruly crowd, officials said.
NYPD sources confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that 133 demonstrators were arrested by police using zip ties and flex cuffs to remove the protesters from campus. They were taken on a bus to police headquarters, where they were charged with trespassing, the sources added.
The NYU Palestine Solidarity Coalition said in an Instagram post that NYU students in their group set up a ""Gaza Solidarity Encampment"" on Monday.
The group is demanding to ""end all war profiteering and investment in genocide,"" a ""complete academic boycott of Israel,"" the removal of NYPD on campus and that NYU ""must protect free speech on campus and provide full amnesty to all students and faculty penalized for their pro-Palestinian activism.""
They claimed the arrests last night were ""violent"" but that ""the violence we faced is only a fraction of the violence that Palestinians face on the ground every day.""
NYU did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment from Fox News Digital regarding the walkout.


Former Education Secretary Bill Bennett said authority must be asserted on college campuses to clamp down on antisemitism at anti-Israel protests.
Bennett joined America's Newsroom on Tuesday to react to the protests at Columbia and New York University's campuses, where dozens of protesters were arrested for trespassing.
""The main thing that has to happen is authority has to be asserted on the campuses,"" Bennett said. ""It's not enough for the presidents to maintain peace, they need to maintain the order and to assert their authority and say, 'this is a university. We do not do this here. You people are ignorant. Go to the library, if you're students that are enrolled here, and read about what happened in the Holocaust.""
He criticized Columbia University's decision to move to virtual classes, calling it a ""win"" for the disruptive protesters.
""The president of that university should say we are open. We are open for business. And anybody who tries to interfere with our students coming on campus will be arrested and, hopefully, for a long time,"" Bennett said.


The University of California- Berkeley is among the latest campuses to join in on the anti-Israel protests sweeping the country, as students occupied part of the Bay Area campus Monday during a sit-in.
UCB Divest, a coalition of students, staff and faculty members, is one of the organizations leading the charge and calling on the community to come out and support their group, in what they call the first encampment of its kind on the West coast, during the occupation of Sproul Plaza.
""WE NEED YOU HERE! We will need you every night throughout this week to take up space with us. We know the Bay Area will not disappoint,"" the group posted on Instagram.
Organizers told Fox News the encampment is in solidarity with students from Columbia University and elsewhere who’ve been arrested, and say the tents will remain until UC divests from corporations -especially military manufacturers- that are helping Israel with the war effort.
The group is also calling on the university to enact policies to protect Palestinian students, and call for an end ""to the violence in Gaza.""
""As students of this university, we have no choice but to take action as UC Berkeley stays silent about our people's genocide and remains complicit in the mass murder of Palestinians,"" the group posted.
The group told Fox News that they are prepared to be arrested. However, Monday's rally was reportedly peaceful and there was no sign of police.

Education Secretary Miguel Cardona released a statement Tuesday condemning the anti-Israel protests on college campuses that led to dozens of arrests.
""Antisemitic hate on college campuses is unacceptable. I am deeply concerned by what is happening at Columbia University. In November 2023, our Office for Civil Rights opened an investigation of Columbia involving Title VI,"" Cardona posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.
""While we can’t comment on pending investigations, every student deserves to feel a sense of safety and belonging at school. Hate has no place in our schools. All education leaders must stand definitively against hate, antisemitism, anti-Arab, and anti-Muslim sentiment,"" the secretary continued.
""Universities are at their best when they promote the respectful exchange of diverse views and constructive debate. Our Office for Civil Rights interprets the civil rights laws we enforce consistent with free speech and other rights protected under the First Amendment.""
""But we won’t tolerate hate or harassment that targets students because of who they are or who they’re perceived to be,"" he concluded.


Columbia University has told FOX Business
 on Tuesday that it is ""grateful"" for Robert Kraft’s ""years of generosity and service"" after the New England Patriots team owner announced he is pulling financial support to his alma mater over the antisemitic protests unfolding there.
On Monday, Kraft, through a statement released by his philanthropic organization Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, said he is ""deeply saddened at the virulent hate that continues to grow on campus and throughout our country"" and that he is no longer ""comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken.""
When asked to respond to his remarks Tuesday, a Columbia spokesperson told FOX Business that ""Columbia is grateful to Mr. Kraft for his years of generosity and service to Columbia.""
""This is a time of crisis for many members of our community and we are focused on providing the support they need while keeping our campus safe,"" the spokesperson added.

Former President Trump addressed the anti-Israel protests on college campuses Tuesday morning, calling them a ""disgrace.""
Speaking ahead of his appearance in Manhattan court for his criminal trial, Trump blamed President Biden for the demonstrations, which have interrupted classes at Columbia and NYU and led to dozens of arrests.
""It's really on Biden, he's got the wrong signal. He's got the wrong tone. He's got the wrong words. He doesn't know who he's backing and it's a mess,"" Trump said.
""If this were me, they'd be after me, they'd be after me so much but they're trying to give him a pass and what's going on is a disgrace to our country, and it's all Biden's fault,"" he continued.
""Everybody knows he's got no message, he's got no compassion and he doesn't know what he's doing, can't put two sentences together. Frankly, he is the worst president in the history of our country.""

President Biden’s latest comment on antisemitic protests on college campuses is being called his ""very fine people on both sides"" moment by some on social media.
Following the president’s Earth Day comments at Prince William Forest Park in Virginia, reporters caught up with Biden and asked for a comment on anti-Israel protests occurring across multiple universities at the time.
""Do you condemn the antisemitic protests on college campuses?"" Biden was asked.
""I condemn the antisemitic protests. That’s why I have set up a program to deal with that. I also condemn those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians,"" he said.
Equating the antisemitic protests with people who ""don’t understand"" the Palestinians ignited several comments accusing Biden of echoing Trump’s ""very fine people on both sides"" Charlottesville comment from 2017.
""This sure sounds like he’s ACTUALLY saying there are very fine people on both sides,"" OutKick founder Clay Travis remarked.
""’Very fine people on both sides,’"" RedState writer Bonchie agreed.
American Spectator writer Nate Hochman noted, ""I'm old enough to remember when ‘good people on both sides’ was evil and racist.""

Police offices arrested more than 100 demonstrators at the anti-Israel protests at New York University's campus on Monday night, NYPD sources told Fox News.
Officers used zip ties and flex cuffs to remove the protesters from campus. They were taken on a bus to police headquarters, where they were charged with trespassing, the sources said.
The arrests come after an NYU spokesperson told local media that the protestors were behaving in a “disorderly, disruptive, and antagonizing manner.""
Earlier, anti-Israel protesters had formed a human chain as police moved in to break up the demonstration.
Video shot by Fox News Digital shows the NYPD telling students: ""You have been warned by New York University to leave the area.""
Those who did not leave soon, would be arrested for trespassing, NYPD said.
NYU's Global Campus Safety posted on Instagram that protesters had breached the barriers set up at Gould Plaza, Fountain Walker.
""The one safety requirement we made was that no additional protestors could enter Gould Plaza. With the breach of the barricades early this afternoon, that requirement was violated, and we witnessed disorderly, disruptive, and antagonizing behavior that has interfered with the safety and security of our community,"" the university said in a statement.
""We cannot tolerate people getting hurt. You will need to clear the plaza by 4:00 pm. If you leave now, no one will face any consequences for today’s actions—no discipline, no police.""
Mass arrests began around 8:30 p.m. Within an hour, the demonstration had largely fizzled out.

An Arab-Israeli journalist said anti-Israel agitators assaulted him ahead of a lecture he was supposed to give at Columbia University last Thursday.
Yoseph Haddad, a journalist, Israel Defense Forces veteran and activist who founded the interfaith group Together Vouch for Each Other, said a pro-Israel student group invited him to speak on campus about the coalition of Arabs and Jews in Israel last week, right as anti-Israel protests rocked the college campus.
When he first arrived, he was alarmed to find agitators chanting ""intifada"" and ""from the river to the sea,"" and confronted the group.
""As an Arab, I know the real meaning of [intifada]. Of course, the direct meaning is, ‘a violent uprising.’ But people do not understand what this ‘violent uprising’ means,"" Haddad told Fox News Digital.
""Intifada means the moral death of Jews, the moral death of Arabs,"" he said.
The Israeli journalist said he asked the group how they could ""literally support terrorism"" before they turned their hostilities toward him. Haddad said they began hurling death threats and antisemitic slurs at him even though he is not Jewish.

Holocaust survivor Tova Friedman called the anti-Israel protests on Ivy League campuses were ""utterly shocking"" and warned that antisemitism ""can only end in tragedy.
Friedman, who was imprisoned at Auschwitz when she was five years old, reacted to footage from the protests at Columbia and New York University's campuses on ""Fox & Friends.""
""I am shocked. I am pained. I'm scared, both for America, I'm scared for the Jews. And very painful for our young people,"" Friedman said. ""What's shocking most of all is that the professors, some of them, are on board.""
Police made dozens of arrests and dispersed the protests at Columbia and NYU as demonstrators screamed antisemitic slogans and demanded that the schools divest from Israel.
Such demonstrations have exploded across college campuses in recent months out of protest at Israel’s offensive in Gaza, which in turn is a reaction to Hamas’ Oct. 7 assault on Israel that saw 1,200 people killed and around 240 taken hostage.
Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry claims that the war has killed at least 34,097 Palestinians and wounded another 76,980, though Israel has disputed these figures. The ministry doesn't differentiate between combatants and civilians in its count.

Harvard University has closed Harvard Yard at the heart of its campus and is restricting access to the outside area until Friday, according to a report, a move that comes as anti-Israel protesters take over open areas of other Ivy League campuses.
Signs posted on the gates of Harvard Yard on Sunday said that the area was closed to non-Harvard ID holders and that ""structures, including tents and tables"" are not permitted without prior permission, the Harvard Crimson first reported.
Blocking pedestrian pathways and access to building entrances was also prohibited, according to the Crimson. The university said that students who violate these policies are subject to disciplinary action.
Fox News Digital reached out to Harvard University but did not immediately receive a response.
The announcement comes after more than 200 anti-Israel protesters gathered in Harvard Yard on Friday and demanded that the university divest from Israeli companies and investments in the West Bank.

Anti-Israel Protests at New York University's campus turned violent Monday night when demonstrators hurled bottles at police officers who were sent to the scene, officials said.
""When NYU asked the NYPD to clear Gould Plaza of individuals who were refusing to disperse and were 'interfering with the safety and security of our community.,' our officers moved in without delay,"" said NYPD Deputy Commissioner, Operations Kaz Daughtry.
""Unfortunately, as they were dispersing the crowd, some chose violence and pelted the police with bottles,"" Daughtry said. ""The professionalism and composure our officers showed as they cleared the plaza — despite these dangerous acts of aggression they encountered  — are to be commended.""
The deputy commissioner shared video that appears to show bottles thrown at police.
Mass arrests began around 8:30 p.m. after the protest escalated the plaza in front of the business school. The university released a statement explaining while it supports students' rights to protest, safety remains its priority.
""Today's events did not need to lead to this outcome,"" NYU spokesperson John Beckman said in a statement.
Beckman said the protests were ""considerably disruptive of classes and other operations in schools around the plaza.""
""Nonetheless we made no move to clear the plaza at that point because high among the University's aims was to avoid any escalation or violence,"" Beckman said. ""So, the University was deeply disturbed when, early this afternoon, additional protesters, many of whom we believe were not affiliated with NYU, suddenly breached the barriers that had been put in place at the north side of the plaza and joined the others already on the plaza. This breach was in violation of directions from Campus Safety Officers and in violation of multiple University rules.""
""This development dramatically changed the situation,"" he continued. ""We witnessed disorderly, disruptive, and antagonizing behavior that has interfered with the safety and security of our community, and that demonstrated how quickly a demonstration can get out of control or people can get hurt.""

On Monday morning, Carter posted an image of the door to his Georgetown, Texas office, splattered with red liquid that spelled out, ""Free Gaza.""
""Unhinged anti-Israel activists vandalized my Georgetown office,"" he posted. ""Let me make 2 things clear, my support of Israel is unwavering & your intimidation won’t work. Secondly, the parties responsible will be found & will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""


FOX 7 in Austin reported that officers with the Georgetown Police Department responded to Carter’s office at about 8:45 a.m. after reports of a possible burglary.
Police told the station it is investigating the vandalism as criminal mischief, which in Texas is a misdemeanor if the loss is between $750 and $2,500.
The incident comes as anti-Israel agitators continue to protest at major cities and universities across the country, including Columbia University in New York City.

Columbia University in New York City announced Monday evening that classes at its main campus will be remote for the remainder of the season over safety concerns following days of anti-Israel protests on campus.
""Safety is our highest priority as we strive to support our students' learning and all the required academic operations,"" Columbia provost Angela V. Olinto said in a message to the university's community.
The Morningside main campus will be moving all classes to hybrid learning, as long as classroom technology permits it, until the end of the Spring semester.
The university stated exceptions for arts and practice-based programs, saying that there will be in-person learning with ""generous accommodations"" supported by school deans and staff.
Courses at the Columbia University Irvine Medical Center and Manhattanville campuses will also remain in-person, operating as usual but offering accommodations for ""religious reasons, or approved disability accommodations.""
""All faculty whose classrooms are located on the main Morningside campus and equipped with hybrid capabilities should enable them to provide virtual learning options to students who need such a learning modality,"" Olinto wrote.
""Faculty in other classrooms or teaching spaces that do not have capabilities for offering hybrid options should hold classes remotely if there are student requests for virtual participation,"" she continued. ""If the class does not permit adapting to the remote offering format, we encourage faculty to provide other accommodations liberally to students who have requested support for virtual learning this week.""

After an anti-Israel protest escalated at New York University on Monday – requiring city police presence – the university released a statement explaining while it supports students' rights to protest, safety remains its priority.
""Today's events did not need to lead to this outcome,"" NYU spokesperson John Beckman said in a statement.
Mass arrests began around 8:30 p.m. and, within an hour, the demonstration had largely fizzled out.
Roughly 50 anti-Israel protesters started a demonstration on the plaza in front of the business school Monday morning without notice or authorization from NYU, according to Beckman.
The university closed access to the plaza, placed barriers and emphasized that it would not allow additional protesters to join the demonstration because it was already ""considerably disruptive of classes and other operations in schools around the plaza,"" Beckman said.
In response to intimidating chants, antisemitic incidents and safety issues, the university requested assistance from the NYPD, who initially urged people on the plaza to leave peacefully before ultimately making several arrests.
""We will continue to support individuals' right to freedom of expression, and, as we have said since October, the safety of our students and maintaining an equitable learning environment remain paramount,"" Beckman said, referring to the initial response to protests following Hamas terrorists' Oct. 7 attack against Israel, which started the ongoing war in the Middle East.


Former CNN host Campbell Brown declared Sunday she is heading to Israel
 with her sons, arguing that the embattled country is currently more welcoming to her Jewish family than New York City, where antisemitic protests have roiled Columbia University.
Just before Passover began, the former news anchor and ex-Meta executive wrote on social media, ""I’m on my way to Israel where my two sons will be safer and feel more welcomed than they would be today on the Upper West Side. #AmYisraelChai [The people of Israel live].""
Brown’s husband, former Bush administration foreign policy adviser and author Dan Senor, responded with a series of emojis in support of her statement.
New York City has been a hotbed of massive anti-Israel protests since the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks. Columbia University, in particular, one of America’s most prestigious universities, has been shaken by such demonstrations in the past several days.

 campus after school officials requested police presence to clear out people who refused to leave the area.
NYPD Deputy Commissioner Kaz Daughtry said the department received a letter from NYU on Monday ""detailing a request to clear Gould Plaza of individuals who were refusing to comply with repeated requests to disperse.""
""They were described as 'interfering with the safety and security of our community.' Our officers responded to the location without delay and dispersed the crowd — making numerous arrests, as necessary,"" Daughtry said.
""There is a pattern of behavior occurring on campuses across our nation, in which individuals attempt to occupy a space in defiance of school policy,"" he continued. ""Rest assured, in NYC the NYPD stands ready to address these prohibited and subsequently illegal actions whenever we are called upon.""

Rabbi Moshe Hauer is calling on the White House and federal government to take a harder stance on combating campus antisemitism after the ""anarchy"" at Columbia University.
""What was very clear last week was basically a cry from the university leadership of Columbia and from the law school, the former law school dean, who's the head of the antisemitism Task Force, that they don't know how to draw the line between what is permitted and what is forbidden. And that task should not be on a task force of the community. That task, that definition, should be provided by the government of the country that tells them what's permitted, what's forbidden,"" Hauer told Fox News Digital.
He continued, ""The Justice Department, the Department of Education, should be telling the schools where the line is, should be telling the schools what appropriate enforcement looks like. Meanwhile, they're left to figure it out for themselves. And that's helping to grow this problem, the absence of crystal-clear guidance from our government and moral support in that enforcement.""
On Sunday, Orthodox Union-Jewish Learning Initiative (OU-JLIC) Director Rabbi Elie Buechler put out a recommendation for Jewish students to return home ahead of Passover.
""The events of the last few days, especially last night, have made it clear that Columbia University’s Public Safety and the NYPD cannot guarantee Jewish students’ safety in the face of extreme antisemitism and anarchy,"" Buechler wrote. ""It deeply pains me to say that I would strongly recommend you return home as soon as possible and remain home until the reality in and around campus has dramatically improved.""

The New York Police Department was making several arrest of pro-Palestinian protesters at New York University on Monday night.
Large crowds were on the campus all day protesting Israel amid its war with Hamas.
Authorities warned the anti-Israel protesters that they needed to disperse. Instead, some began forming a human chain as the police moved in. The participants also denounced capitalism and stomped on the Israeli flag.
""This is the New York City Police Department,” an officer is heard saying over a loudspeaker. “You have been warned by New York University to leave the area. Please leave the plaza now or you will be arrested for trespass.""
At least two police buses and several police vans were seen in the area.


As Columbia University President Dr. Nemat ""Minouche"" Shafik faces scrutiny from ongoing campus protests over Israel’s war with Hamas, a more than 20-year-old video is getting renewed attention for remarks on the causes of terrorism.
The video, filmed just two months after 9/11, shows Shafik – who was then vice president at the World Bank – discussing the economic roots of terrorism with UC Berkeley’s Harry Kreisler on the program, ""Conversations with History.""
Shafik argued that although terrorism has sprung up in ""fairly rich and open societies,"" its most fertile ground is in countries beset by ""economic stagnation and political authoritarianism.""
""You’ll always have individuals with extreme views. But what’s really troubling in the region is that there’s actually quite a broad base of society which has some sympathy for the terrorists, not so much because they approve of their methods, but it’s a form of protesting against a system which is not delivering for them on the economic or the political front,"" she said.
The video was first unearthed by The Daily Wire’s Brent Scher.

Students at one of Columbia University’s undergraduate colleges has voted in favor of a referendum asking if the school should divest from Israel.
Students at Columbia College were asked if the university should divest financially from Israel, cancel the Tel Aviv Global Center, and end Columbia’s dual degree program with Tel Aviv University, the Columbia Spector reported.
More than 60% of the 2,013 students who voted were in favor of divestment for each of the three questions.
“Columbia University welcomes and embraces the Israeli students, faculty, and staff on our campus,” a University spokesperson wrote in a statement to Spectator, the student newspaper.
“We also benefit greatly from our dual degree program with Tel Aviv University.”
The vote has no impact on university policy but lets officials know where students stand.
Teji Vijayakumar, president of the Columbia College Student Council, told the student newspaper she doesn’t “necessarily think that this referendum will be enough to get divestment.""
Vijayakumar, instead, hopes the university senate will put out a university-wide referendum to form a consensus on the matter. The referendum results came amid days of protests at the university in which participants have called for a halt of aid to Israel.

Harvard University has suspended its Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee and ordered them to cease all organizational activities for the remainder of the Spring 2024 term or risk permanent expulsion, according to reports.
The group confirmed the suspension on its Instagram account.
The PSC was one of several groups to stage a rally at Harvard Yard, located at the heart of the Ivy League campus, last week in solidarity with students at Columbia University, The Harvard Crimson reported.
More than 100 students were arrested last week during protests at Columbia, many for trespassing, the New York Police Department said.
Harvard told the PSC that suspension came after the group failed to register a demonstration and violated university guidelines on the use of space.
The group had previously been placed on probation by the College in March, according to the email, according to the student newspaper.
“The organization will not be recognized and will not have access to university benefits and services during this time, including but not limited to use of campus space and appropriate use of the Harvard name,” the email stated. “If the organization continues to operate and commits additional violations during this suspension, the organization risks permanent expulsion, as provided in the Resource Guide.”

New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday called the anti-Israel protests at Columbia University “concerning and painful.”
“The events that have occurred at Columbia University have been deeply concerning and painful for many,” James said in a statement. “The right to protest peacefully is the bedrock of our nation’s democracy. However, when peaceful protest devolves into hate and antisemitic violence, the line is crossed and will not be tolerated. My office is monitoring the situation closely.
“We know the dire consequences of failing to stand tall in the face of hate, and this moment must be a clarion call to respond to those who seek to spark the flames of division,” she added.
James said her office was monitoring the protests closely.

Sixty people were arrested at Yale University for refusing to voluntarily leave a portion of the Connecticut campus, the school president said Monday evening.
Those arrested were taken into custody by Yale police after they refused to leave an encampment set up last week. Of those arrested, 47 were Yale students, university president Peter Salovey said in a message.
“I am grateful that we were able to take these actions peacefully and that none of the protesters
 resisted arrest,” he said. “We will pursue disciplinary action to address possible violations of our policies, particularly those policies prohibiting threats, intimidation, coercion, harassment, and physical harm as well as conduct that interferes with university operations.”
Salovey noted that the protesters were warned that unauthorized use of campus space would result in disciplinary and legal action.
“Members of the Jewish, Muslim, Israeli, Arab, and Palestinian communities reported that the campus environment had become increasingly difficult,” he said.
“We then became aware of police reports identifying harmful acts and threatening language used against individuals at or near the protest sites,"" he added.


Protesters at New York University displayed solidarity with the Palestinian people on Monday as displays against Israel continue on college campuses.
Video footage at a gathering in Manhattan show a crowd chanting “Free, Free Palestine” and “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.”
The slogan is a pro-Palestinian liberation phrase that has been used by Hamas and other anti-Israel actors as a call to arms against the Jewish state.
It refers to the land between the Jordan River and The Mediterranean Sea, which encompasses Israel. A House resolution condemning the phrase recently passed with 44 Democrats and one Republican opposing.
Protesters were also chanting anti-police phrases'
""No Justice, no peace. F*** these racists a** police,"" they were heard saying.


Pro-Palestinian activists on Monday organized a “Camp Free Palestine” in front at the University of California at Berkeley, similar to what students at Columbia University in New York have done in recent days.
The gathering spot was in front of Sprout Hall in the main quad area of the campus. As of Monday afternoon, there was at least a dozen tents.
“With three weeks left in the semester, Berkeley is prioritizing students’ academic interests,” a school statement to Fox News states. “We will take the steps necessary to ensure the protest does not disrupt the university’s operations. There are no plans to change the university's investment policies and practices.”
Organizers with the UC Berkeley Graduate Students for Justice in Palestine said the encampment is in solidarity with students from Columbia University and elsewhere who’ve been arrested. They said the tents will remain until the school divests from corporations, particularly military manufacturers, that are aiding Israel
 in its war effort against Hamas.
Participants said they were prepared to be arrested. A rally on Monday drew several hundred people and was peaceful.

Despite multiple efforts on Monday to get an answer from the White House, officials remained silent on the issue of whether President Biden intends to deploy the National Guard to break up anti-Israel protests at Columbia University.
Fox News Digital asked the White House whether it would comment on the situation at Columbia University and if it required federal intervention, but didn't receive any response. The silence comes as hundreds of anti-Israel agitators have mounted disruptive protests at the university's campus in New York City, with some calling for violence against Jews and Jewish students.
""Eisenhower sent the 101st to Little Rock,"" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said in a social media post Monday. ""It’s time for Biden to call out the National Guard at our universities to protect Jewish Americans.""
""The nascent pogroms at Columbia have to stop TODAY, before our Jewish brethren sit for Passover Seder tonight,"" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., added. ""If Eric Adams won’t send the NYPD and Kathy Hochul won’t send the National Guard, Joe Biden has a duty to take charge and break up these mobs.""
Last week, anti-Israel agitators initiated protests, staging what they labeled a ""Gaza solidarity encampment"" on the Columbia University campus and shutting down a central lawn at the university. The protesters, who erected tents as part of the action, called for hostilities in the Middle East to end and for the university to divest of companies that have ties to Israel.

Pro-Palestinian agitators who had occupied Yale University’s Beinecke Plaza over the weekend put on a toned-down display at a single intersection on the edge of campus Monday after police shut down their encampment in the morning.
Yale police announced 47 student arrests after the demonstrators refused the school’s invitation to voice their concerns with university trustees and also ignored police requests to clear out.
On Monday afternoon, traffic around the intersection of Grove and College streets was closed to cars as more than 200 people gathered, some singing pro-Palestinian slogans as many sat in the sun with their laptops and beach chairs.
Campus police and their city of New Haven counterparts maintained a visible presence as activists handed out snacks and drinks in the Connecticut college town.


Code Pink, the anti-war group, protested in support of the Palestinian people Monday at a large book festival being held at the University of Southern California.
Group members visited the LA Times Festival of Books on the USC campus to also support 2024 valedictorian, Asna Tabassum, who was supposed to give her valedictorian remarks at this years commencement ceremony before the school scrapped canceled the speech.
""Today at the LA Times Festival of Books we put Palestine on the agenda!"" Code Pink posted on X. ""Ahead of World Central Kitchen’s Jose Andres’ speech, we demanded accountability for Israel’s murder of 35,000+ Palestinians and WCK aid workers. FREE FREE PALESTINE.""
Code Pink members were seen walking on the Los Angeles campus with signs calling for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and holding Palestinian flags.
Last week, USC announced it would be not be allowing Tabassum, a biomedical engineering major, to give her valedictorian speech during the main stage commencement after a series of social media posts she made about Israel.
""To be clear: this decision has nothing to do with freedom of speech. There is no free-speech entitlement to speak at a commencement. The issue here is how best to maintain campus security and safety, period,"" Andrew Guzman, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs, wrote in the statement.


Several congressional lawmakers decried antisemitism on college campuses, particularly Columbia University, this weekend as anti-Israel protesters briefly took over a part of the Ivy League school campus, resulting in hundreds of arrests.
Amid the demonstrations that began last week, Columbia University President Dr. Nemat ""Minouche"" Shafik said in a statement posted Monday that she was ""deeply saddened"" by certain actions of agitators, who have formed an ""encampment"" on the campus and have riled students and faculty with anti-Jewish slogans and chants.
""I am deeply saddened by what is happening on our campus,"" Shafik wrote. ""Our bonds as a community have been severely tested in ways that will take a great deal of time and effort to reaffirm. Students across an array of communities have conveyed fears for their safety and we have announced additional actions we are taking to address security concerns. The decibel of our disagreements has only increased in recent days. These tensions have been exploited and amplified by individuals who are not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus to pursue their own agendas.""
U.S. Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., visited the university over the weekend to stand with Jewish students, some of whom have said they don't feel safe on campus.

’s Beinecke Plaza demanding divestment from weapon manufacturers turned down a chance to meet with school trustees and the chairperson of the campus’ investor responsibility committee on Sunday before they were arrested in a Monday morning raid, according to a university official. Yale authorities spent the weekend attempting to negotiate with the group to no avail.
""The university also spent several hours in discussion with student protesters yesterday, offering them the opportunity to meet with trustees, including the chair of the Corporation Committee on Investor Responsibility (CCIR), and to avoid arrest if they left the plaza by the end of the weekend,"" a Yale University spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""They declined this offer and continued to occupy the plaza.""
According to the university's website, the board of trustees had a pre-planned meeting scheduled for Saturday. But the agitators made their demands without meeting the board, the spokesperson said.

A number of Democrats in the Senate have joined their Republican colleagues in denouncing discrimination against Jewish students at the prestigious Ivy League Columbia University, where an anti-Israel solidarity encampment persists on campus, prompting the institution to move classes online on Monday.
""Every American has a right to protest,"" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement.
""But when protests shift to antisemitism, verbal abuse, intimidation, or glorification of Oct. 7 violence against Jewish people, that crosses the line.""
""Campuses must remain safe for all students.""
Schumer, who represents New York City, where Columbia is located, is the first Jewish majority leader in the Senate and also the highest ranking Jewish elected official in U.S. history.
Last week, the anti-Israel demonstration sprang up on Columbia's campus, with students camping out in tents and demanding that the university divest from all companies with ties to Israel. Since then, the protest has grown in size and presented a safety threat to Jewish students. This has mushroomed into such a concern that an Orthodox rabbi at the school advised Jewish students to leave campus because ""Columbia University’s Public Safety and the NYPD cannot guarantee Jewish students’ safety.""

A Jewish Columbia University professor who has been critical of the school’s response to widespread anti-Israel protests and planned a counter demonstration said Monday that he was blocked from entering the main campus.
Assistant business professor Shai Davidai, who was born in Israel and has called for Columbia leadership to resign as anti-Israel agitators wreak havoc on campus, said his keycard to enter the school’s main campus had been deactivated.
""I have, not just a civil right, a civil right as a Jewish person to be on campus. I have a right as a professor employed by the university to be on campus. They deactivated my card,"" Davidai told demonstrators Monday.
The moment when Davidai apparently realized his entry card was deactivated was captured on video that quickly spread on social media.
""My card has been deactivated? Why? Wait, wait, wait, everybody my card has been deactivated. This is Cas Holloway, the COO [Chief Operating Officer], this is [Vice President for Public Safety] Gerald Lewis. They were in the meeting when I asked them if Hamas is a terror organization, and they couldn’t say that it is a terrorist organization,"" Davidai told the crowd as Holloway and Lewis looked on.
Fox News Digital's Brian Flood contributed to this post.
Republicans from New York in the House of Representatives have written a letter Monday calling for Columbia University President Minouche Shafik to resign over her handling of the anti-Israel demonstrations on campus.
""Over the past few days, anarchy has engulfed the campus of Columbia University. As the leader of this institution, one of your chief objectives, morally and under law, is to ensure students have a safe learning environment,"" they wrote. ""By every measure, you have failed this obligation. The situation unfolding on campus right now is a direct product of your policies and misguided decisions.""
""As Representatives from the State of New York, many of our constituents are directly impacted by the unfolding chaos on Columbia's campus,"" they continued. ""Based on these recent events and your testimony in front of Congress, we have no confidence in your leadership of this once esteemed institution.""
The letter was co-signed by Reps. Elise Stefanik, Nicole Malliotakis, Claudia Tenney, Nicholas Langworthy, Michael Lawler, Anthony D'Esposito, Nick LaLota, Brandon Williams, Andrew Garbarino and Marcus Molinaro.

New England Patriots team owner Robert Kraft made it his mission to ""stand up to Jewish hate"" in the wake of the Oct. 7 terror attacks in Israel and on Monday he went a step further.
Kraft announced he was pulling his support for Columbia University amid the antisemitic violence at the Ivy League school. He released a statement through his philanthropic organization, Foundation to Combat Antisemitism.
""It was through the full academic scholarship Columbia gave me that I was able to attend college and get my start in life and for that I have been tremendously grateful,"" Kraft’s statement read. ""However, the school I love so much – the one that welcomed me and provided me with so much opportunity – is no longer an institution I recognize.
""I am deeply saddened at the virulent hate that continues to grow on campus and throughout our country. I am no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff and I am not comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken.


Liberal comedian and actor Michael Rapoport said Monday that the anti-Israel protests that are happening at Columbia University are “not the New York way” and are an “embarrassment to New York City.”
Rapoport, speaking near Columbia University, said “as offensive as these people are across the street, agenda number one... is to free our hostages,” prompting a crowd to start chanting “bring them home!”
""These are bullies. These are cowards. These are pathetic, low-life scumbags,"" Rapoport continued. ""Agenda number one A is to eradicate Hamas to the very last one of them.""
""For all you Jewish younger people... be prouder, be louder than you've ever been before about being Jewish,” Rapoport also said.
""Do not be afraid of being Jewish, especially in New York City. Nobody should be afraid of what they are,” he added. “Their race, their religion, their sexuality in this city.”

A wealthy young woman who avoided prison time for a deadly 2020 crash that killed a Vermont couple was among 114 anti-Israel agitators arrested at Columbia University last week – enraging the victims' family.
Protests have been rocking the campus in recent days as anti-Israel sympathizers demand the Israeli military stop fighting back after Hamas terrorists launched an attack on the country in October.
Things have gotten so bad that a campus rabbi is urging Jewish students to leave amid concerns for their safety.
One of the protesters is Isabel Jennifer Seward, now 20, the New York Post revealed, citing arrest records. She was 16 when she allegedly drove over the double yellow lines and plowed into Chet and Connie Hawkins, 73 and 72. Police reports allege she made no effort to avoid the crash.
""She has no remorse, she received no punishment. She’s just prancing around Columbia with her Ivy League privilege,"" the couple's 49-year-old niece, Eve Taylor, told the Post Sunday. ""After basically getting away with murder, she’s now promoting murder, with no understanding of what she’s promoting.""
NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Tarik Sheppard said Monday that ""there's been no credible threats to any particular group or individual coming from this protest or any other"" at Columbia University, where anti-Israel demonstrations have been raging.
Deputy Commissioner of Operations Kaz Daughtry added that the local bureau commander ""has been in close contact with the school administration here, and they asked -- the only NYPD assistance that they have currently asked for -- is for us to patrol the outside, the outer perimeter of the school.""
""We have received reports that Israeli students walking on campus had their flags taken away from them, snatched out of their hands. We also received reports that the Israeli students -- there were some hateful things that were said towards them and they want to know if that was a crime or not,"" Daughtry added. ""But there has been we have received any reports of any physical harm against any student. However, if there's any student, Jewish or whoever that's been assaulted or wants to make a police report or wants to talk to the police, we encourage them to call 911.""
Michael Gerber, the NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Legal Matters, said Monday that “any kind of violence is not going to be tolerated” as anti-Israel demonstrations have upended Columbia University.
""Any kind of property damage is not going it is not going to be tolerated,” he continued. “Any sort of criminality is not going to be tolerated. And that includes harassment or threats or menacing or stalking or anything like that that is not protected by the First Amendment.”
Gerber earlier said ""Columbia University is private property"" and ""absent some ongoing crime, we cannot just go on the Columbia campus as we see fit.”
""It is up to the university to decide whether or not they want us on campus. As a general matter, Columbia University -- and this goes back many years -- does not want NYPD present on campus. That is their decision,” Gerber added.
""Last week, on Thursday, they informed us that they had students who were trespassing. They asked us to come on the campus to take action, and we did,” he continued. “But that was an exceptional case in the normal course. They've made clear that we're not to be there.”


The New York City Police Department is expected to hold a news conference in just minutes regarding recent anti-Israel demonstrations at Columbia University in Manhattan.

A Republican congresswoman from New York is calling Monday for Columbia University President Minouche Shafik to resign over anti-Israel demonstrations on campus.
""It’s clear Columbia University President Shafik can’t get her school under control or protect her students & she should resign,"" Rep. Nicole Malliotakis wrote on X.
 ""The gross antisemitism being displayed against Jewish students at Columbia University is horrific, unacceptable and the reason I introduced legislation to strip federal funding from colleges that blatantly allow antisemitism & don’t hold those responsible accountable.""
Rep. Elise Stefanik, a fellow New York Republican, made a similar call on Sunday for Shafik to step down.


A Jewish student journalist at Yale University says a protester wielding a Palestinian flag jabbed her in the eye during a rowdy anti-Israel protest on campus Saturday evening and got away with it.
Sahar Tartak, editor-in-chief of the Yale Free Press, had been covering the protest, which had drawn hundreds of students in support of Palestinians, when she says she was surrounded by a mob of protesters.
""One of the students, whose face was covered in a keffiyeh, took a Palestinian flag that he was holding, waved it in my face and hit my left eye,"" Tartak said.
Tartak tried to run after the assailant, but the human blockade prevented her from pursuing him because ""they wanted to protect him."" Others were laughing at her, and none made an effort to track him down, she said.
""He had anonymity because of the keffiyeh. The organizers encourage anonymity at these events because it creates immunity, so that students can physically assault people like me and then get away with it,"" she said.


Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., reiterated his criticisms of activists calling for cease-fire in Gaza, and slammed fellow Democrats for their ""crazy"" response to the attacks Iran has launched against Israel, in an interview with Fox Digital.
""It is not appropriate or legal or helpful to advance your argument if you show up in a Starbucks with a bullhorn and start yelling at people,"" he told Fox News Digital in a Friday interview.
He also claimed such protests don't ""make you noble.""
""It just makes you an a--hole,"" Fetterman said.
Since the onset of the war between Israel and terrorist group Hamas, anti-Israel demonstrations have erupted across the U.S. The protesters have gone to extreme lengths at times to telegraph their displeasure with U.S. policy in regard to Israel. Some have trespassed in government buildings, blocked high-traffic bridges and entered private businesses with bullhorns, chanting at employees.


Columbia University student Andrew Parker Stein told ‘Fox & Friends’ on Monday that ""I no longer feel physically safe on my campus” due to anti-Israel demonstrations there.
Stein, speaking on the first day of Passover, said he and Jewish students came to the campus Saturday night to “sing songs of peace” to what has been described as a “Gaza Solidarity Encampment.”
But on the way out, “a pro-Hamas mob started chasing us, calling us – in the middle of campus – calling us inbred, that we have no culture” and stole an Israeli flag from a student, he said.
“They tried to light his flag on fire,” he said. “After that, on the way out, we were talking to public safety – they started following us on the way out – and public safety just shrugged their shoulders,” Stein added. “They are the ones who are responsible in protecting us.""
Fellow student Elisha Baker added that “we know that these are anti-Semites using anti-Semitic rhetoric” and “now we see what happens when you don’t shut down anti-Semitic rhetoric and you allow these people to feel entitled.”

New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Sunday warned that the New York City Police Department ""cannot have a presence"" at Columbia University’s campus ""unless specifically requested by senior university officials,"" decrying ""professional agitators"" and ""antisemitism being spewed"" at the Ivy League School.
""I am horrified and disgusted
 with the antisemitism being spewed at and around the Columbia University campus,"" Adams said, citing the example of a young woman holding a sign with an arrow pointing to Jewish students stating ""Al-Qasam’s Next Targets.""
The Al-Qassam Brigade is the military wing of Hamas.
The mayor noted another instance where a woman is literally yelling ""We are Hamas,"" and another where groups of students are chanting ""We don’t want no Zionists here.""
""I condemn this hate speech in the strongest of terms. Supporting a terrorist organization that aims to kill Jews is sickening and despicable. As I have repeatedly said, hate has no place in our city, and I have instructed the NYPD to investigate any violation of law that is reported. Rest assured, the NYPD will not hesitate to arrest anyone who is found to be breaking the law,"" Adams continued. ""We will not be a city of lawlessness, and those professional agitators seeking to seize the ongoing conflict in the Middle East to sow chaos and division in our city will not succeed.""

Police began removing anti-Israel protesters from an encampment on Yale’s campus early Monday after a week of protests calling for the university to divest from military weapon manufacturers.
Between 40 and 45 protesters were arrested as police looked through tents set up in the encampment near Beinecke Plaza, Yale Police Chief Anthony Campbell told the Yale Daily News reported. Beinecke Plaza is where more than 250 agitators had gathered Sunday night.
Protest organizers told the paper that at least some of those arrested are students.
Campbell told the Yale Daily News that the arrested protesters would be charged with trespassing, a Class A misdemeanor, and would be released once they are processed.

Students at Columbia University were told in an overnight statement that all classes will be held virtually on Monday as anti-Israel protesters have taken over the campus, its president announced.
Columbia University President Dr. Nemat ""Minouche"" Shafik said in a statement posted in the early hours Monday morning, that she was ""deeply saddened"" by certain actions of agitators, who have formed an ""encampment"" on the campus and have riled students and faculty with anti-Jewish slogans and chants.
""I am deeply saddened by what is happening on our campus,"" Shafik wrote. ""Our bonds as a community have been severely tested in ways that will take a great deal of time and effort to reaffirm. Students across an array of communities have conveyed fears for their safety and we have announced additional actions we are taking to address security concerns. The decibel of our disagreements has only increased in recent days. These tensions have been exploited and amplified by individuals who are not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus to pursue their own agendas.""
""We need a reset,"" she added. ""To deescalate the rancor and give us all a chance to consider next steps, I am announcing that all classes will be held virtually on Monday. Faculty and staff who can work remotely should do so; essential personnel should report to work according to university policy. Our preference is that students who do not live on campus will not come to campus.

FBI director sounds alarm on rising threats after Oct. 7: Is anyone listening?,"FBI Director Christopher Wray warns he has never seen a threat environment as America currently faces, with 'blinking lights' flashing from China, the border, and terrorism threats at the same time
Whether it’s terrorism, China, or an insecure border, the U.S. faces a litany of threats both internally and internationally, according to the FBI.
FBI Director Christopher Wray has repeatedly warned of a ""heightened threat environment,"" and has pleaded with lawmakers to take each one seriously.
Connecting all of these disparate threats is the FBI’s ability to adequately address them. At a House Appropriations Subcommittee earlier this month, Wray said the FBI’s fiscal year 2024 budget was around $500 million below what the bureau needed to sustain its 2023 efforts.

Wray said the budget shortfall ""could not have come at a worse time"" given that the U.S., according to the bureau, is in a ""heightened threat environment.""
""As I look back over my career in law enforcement, I would be hard-pressed to think of a time where so many threats to public safety and national security were so elevated all at once, but that is the case as I sit here today,"" Wray told House lawmakers.
His comments came days before the House passed a $95 billion aid package in military aid for Ukraine and Israel.
""After Oct. 7 is when we went to a whole other level.""
Here is an assessment from the FBI Director of some of the top threats the U.S. faces in the coming months and years.
CHINA
Of all the threats the U.S. faces, the FBI has signaled that China far outweighs them all. According to Wray, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has built up a vast cybersecurity and counterintelligence apparatus devoted to theft of intellectual property and criminality.
Wray spoke about the threat posed by China during a summit on Modern Conflict and Emerging Threats at Vanderbilt University last week.
China’s hacking program, Wray said, was larger than that of every other major nation combined – and that’s only magnified by the PRC’s military and growing use of artificial intelligence.
""You could close your eyes and pull an industry or sector out of a hat and, chances are, Beijing has targeted it.""
To give a sense of the scope of the PRC’s operations, Wray said that even if the bureau’s top cyber agents and cyber intelligence analysts were focused solely on China – and not on ransomware, Iran, or Russia – ""Chinese hackers would still (conservatively) outnumber FBI cyber personnel by at least 50 to 1.""
He said Beijing has hit just about every American industry – whether it be biotech, aviation, AI, health, or agriculture – to steal U.S. intellectual property.
CHINA SPENDING ‘DRASTICALLY MORE’ ON MILITARY THAN DECLARED, US ADMIRAL SAYS
""You could close your eyes and pull an industry or sector out of a hat and, chances are, Beijing has targeted it,"" Wray said. ""The PRC is engaged in the largest and most sophisticated theft of intellectual property and expertise in the history of the world, leveraging its most powerful weapons, starting with cyber.""
Wray previously told lawmakers that there has been far too little public focus on the fact that PRC hackers are targeting the U.S.’ critical infrastructure ""in preparation to wreak havoc and cause real-world harm to American citizens and communities.""

China’s malign efforts, Wray said, are driven largely by the Chinese Communist Party’s ""aspirations to wealth and power,"" as it seeks to seize economic development in the areas most critical to tomorrow’s economy.
Compounding these threats is China’s long-term goal to retake Taiwan. Per Wray, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence last year assessed that Beijing was building out its capability to deter U.S. intervention in a potential crisis between China and Taiwan by 2027.
Wray warned in January that the PRC had ""circled"" the year 2027 on its calendar and will ""be on us before you know it.""

""I do want the American people to know that we cannot afford to sleep on this danger. As a government and a society, we’ve got to remain vigilant and actively defend against the threat that Beijing poses,"" Wray said in January. ""Otherwise, China has shown it will make us pay.""

At that same hearing, Wray called China’s ""multi-pronged assault"" on our national and economic security ""the defining threat of our generation.""
BORDER
Securing the border remains a top issue for American voters, particularly amid the rise of suspects on the terrorist watch list as well as the proliferation of deadly fentanyl into communities nationwide.
Wray told lawmakers at a House Appropriations Subcommittee on April 11 that the bureau continues to see drug cartels pushing ""fentanyl and other dangerous drugs into every corner of the country.""
""Let’s not forget that it didn’t take a big number of people on 9/11 to kill 3,000 people.""
He noted at Vanderbilt University last week that many of fentanyl’s precursor chemicals that end up in our communities ""are coming out of China.""
At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in December, Wray said the bureau had seized enough fentanyl to kill 270 million people.
SENATE WON'T PASS BORDER SECURITY LEGISLATION THIS YEAR, JOHNSON'S OFFICE SUGGESTS
""That’s about 80% of all Americans,"" Wray said. ""We’re also focused on other threats that emanate from the border and impact communities all over the country, things like violent gangs and human traffickers.""
At the same hearing, Wray said terrorists' ability to ""exploit any port of entry, including our Southwest border, is a source of concern.""

""There’s a lot of discussion about numbers – and numbers are important – but let’s not forget that it didn’t take a big number of people on 9/11 to kill 3,000 people,"" he said, noting that the bureau has seen an increase in ""suspected terrorists attempting to cross (the border) over the last five years.""

Asked by Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., in December whether the U.S. was seeing the largest terrorist threat since 9/11, Wray said the threat was ""higher than it’s been in a long, long time.""
""I see blinking lights everywhere I turn,"" Wray told Graham.
TERRORISM
Wray said earlier this month that the U.S. was at a ""heightened threat level"" of terrorism even before Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas militants stormed into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages.
""After Oct. 7 is when we went to a whole other level,"" Wray told the House Appropriations Subcommittee on April 11.

Wray said the FBI has seen a ""rogue’s gallery of foreign terrorist organizations calling for attacks on us.""
HEZBOLLAH CLAIMS TO SHOOT DOWN ISRAELI DRONE OVER LEBANON
This includes Hezbollah in Lebanon praising Hamas and threatening to attack U.S. interests in the region. It includes Al Qaeda issuing its most ""specific call for an attack"" on the U.S. in the past half-decade.
AQAP, which is Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, as well as ISIS have called for jihadists to attack Americans and Jewish communities in the U.S. In Afghanistan, home to Al Qaeda and ISIS-K, the U.S. has lost some of its intelligence gathering capabilities following the chaotic withdrawal of U.S.

Wray also pointed to the growth of other terrorist groups in Africa like Al Shabab – the best funded branch of Al Qaeda – as well ISIS’s attempt to ""free some very dangerous fighters"" in Syria.
Wray said these terrorist groups typically don’t see eye to eye, but are united in one thing: calling for attacks on the U.S.

""When organizations like Al Qaeda, like ISIS, express an intent to conduct attacks against us, it is something we need to take very seriously,"" Wray said. ""And so, that’s part of why I’ve highlighted this as a heightened threat.""

"Senate approves $95B aid package for Ukraine and Israel, bill that forces TikTok's hand","Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram breaks down the House's votes on the foreign aid package and where the looming motion to vacate stands on 'Fox News Live.'
A $95 billion package with aid to both Ukraine and Israel passed the Senate on Tuesday night after the House's various adjustments were approved in the lower chamber over the weekend.
By a vote of 79 to 18, the Senate sent the package to President Biden's desk, and he is expected to sign off on the additional foreign aid. It notably passed with more votes than the previous Senate-passed version had garnered in February.
The package ultimately included aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, alongside measures requiring TikTok to divest from Chinese-owned ByteDance and to allow $5 billion in Russian assets held in U.S. banks to be transferred to Ukraine.

Biden had initially requested the supplemental foreign aid in October. A different version of the package with funds for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan passed the Senate in February but was never voted on in the House.
Under the measures, roughly $61 billion is set aside for supporting Ukraine in the war against Russia, about $26 billion is allotted for Israel and humanitarian aid, and nearly $8 billion is provided for the Indo-Pacific and Taiwan.
The Senate cleared the way for quick passage of the bills earlier on Tuesday when it voted in favor of invoking cloture, 81-19.

After the cloture motion passed, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., celebrated, telling senators in floor remarks, ""In a resounding bipartisan vote, the relentless work of six long months has paid off: Congress is sending the supplemental to President Biden’s desk.""
""This is an important day for America and a very important day for freedom-loving countries around the world,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., remarked to reporters following the vote to invoke cloture.

Prior to the cloture vote, a significant number of senators sought a motion to table an amendment tree, which blocks other amendments from being considered in regular order. The motion to table was a close vote, with 48 supporting it and 50 voting against, allowing the amendment tree to stand.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., released a statement following the motion's failure, noting that it meant his amendment wouldn't be considered. He wanted to see votes on his two amendments to the package, which would have ended unconditional aid to Israel and restored funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).

""Polls show that a majority of Americans, and a very strong majority of Democrats, want to end U.S. taxpayer support for Netanyahu’s war against the Palestinian people,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""It is a dark day for democracy when the Senate will not even allow a vote on that issue.""

A number of Republican lawmakers also wanted votes on their respective amendments, including Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who proposed an amendment to require repayment of the foreign aid loan to Ukraine, in order to make it ""real.""
If any amendments were passed in the Senate, the bill would be sent back to the House for its consideration once again.

"Disgraced former DA racked up 'fancy meals' on taxpayer-funded credit card, report says","Passover, Trump Trial, New York Jury
Rachael Rollins, the former Biden-nominated US Attorney of Massachusetts who resigned in disgrace over ethics violations may have also violated guidelines on spending with a taxpayer-funded credit card as district attorney, a new investigation claims.
Last year, Rollins stepped down from her US Attorney post after a lengthy DOJ ethics probe into her appearance at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser featuring first lady Jill Biden. Before being nominated to the role by President Biden, Rollins was district attorney for Suffolk County, which includes Boston, from 2019 to 2022.
In a new report, The Boston Herald used public records requests to look into the former top Democratic official's spending on her taxpayer-funded credit card while she was DA for the Boston-area.
Their investigation found she spent ""lavishly"" on meals at ""fancy restaurants"" on the government-issued card during her tenure in ""what appears to be a blatant violation of state guidelines.""

""In one week in June of 2021, she spent $115.23 at the Atlantic Fish Company in the Back Bay, $156.54 at Davio’s in the North End, and $195.82 at the Salty Dog in Faneuil Hall, where oysters are 'shucked to order,'""  the Herald reported.
Credit card receipts also allegedly show Rollins spent $128.79 at Sonsie on Newbury Street, and $93.58 at the Barcelona Wine Bar on Tremont Street.
Later that year, Rollins also reportedly used the taxpayer credit card to fund a trip to New York City. There she spent over $200 dining at the Merchants River House, which overlooks the Statue of Liberty. Her trip also included spending over $400 between a hotel bill and Uber rides, the report stated.
During another trip to NYC, Rollins reportedly spent $423.84 on the same card at an Italian restaurant in the city.
Rollins also spent $666 at a seafood restaurant called The Sole Proprietor in Worcester during a week's span toward the end of 2021, the report found.
She also reportedly used the card to spend small amounts on fast food, coffee and meal delivery, despite her over $190,000 reported salary as DA.

These expenditures present a problem as they appear to violate guidelines for the state-issued credit card, called a ""P-card.""
The state Comptroller’s office forbids using P-cards to pay for meals, snacks, coffee and alcohol, according to its website.
Rollins did not return a request for comment on the report to the Herald or to Fox News Digital.
During her tenure as Suffolk County District Attorney, Rollins was criticized by Republicans for declining to prosecute low-level offenses such as shoplifting, trespassing, and drug possession.
However, she was praised by liberal media outlets and Democrats in Congress over her approach to crime in the Boston area.
""Rollins has been among President Biden’s smartest appointments,"" the Los Angeles Times' editorial board wrote about her nomination to U.S. attorney in 2021.
Massachusetts Democratic Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren described Rollins as ""a great choice for U.S. Attorney,"" and that they were ""proud to recommend her to the Biden administration.""

After her fall from grace, Rollins accepted a part-time administration job at Roxbury Community College. She is helping to develop a program that will support prisoners re-entering society, according to an announcement to faculty made public earlier this year.
Roxbury Community College did not return a request for comment from Fox News Digital.
The school declined to comment when reached by The Herald.

Law professor roasts Manhattan DA's case against Trump in NY Times guest essay,"Fox News legal editor Kerri Kupec Urbahn joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss her key takeaways from Trump's trial in New York City as a judge is set to decide whether the former president violated his gag order.
Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's case against former President Trump is a ""historic mistake,"" a law professor argued in an opinion piece published Tuesday.
In a New York Times guest essay, Boston University law professor Jed Handelsman Shugerman argued Bragg was overreaching in his attempts to try a federal election crime under New York state law. He said the Manhattan's DA allegation against Trump was ""vague"" since the prosecution failed to specify ""an election crime or a valid theory of fraud.""
Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records in relation to alleged hush money payments made to pornography actress Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 election. The presumptive GOP presidential nominee returned to court Tuesday as the trial continues, Fox News Digital reported.

GOV GAVIN NEWSOM WORRIES ABOUT ‘OVERINDULGENCE,’ ‘OBSESSION’ WITH TRUMP HUSH MONEY TRIAL: ‘LESS IS MORE’
Shugerman suggested Bragg should instead center his argument around the idea that ""it's not the crime; it's the cover-up"" and pointed to allegedly falsified business records.
""Most of them were entered in early 2017, generally before Mr. Trump filed his Federal Election Commission report that summer. Mr. Trump may have foreseen an investigation into his campaign, leading to its financial records. Mr. Trump may have falsely recorded these internal records before the FEC filing as consciously part of the same fraud: to create a consistent paper trail and to hide intent to violate federal election laws, or defraud the FEC,"" Shugerman wrote.
However, the law professor noted Bragg's filing and Monday's opening statements do not indicate prosecutors were following this approach. He also conceded that his own explanation could also have ""significant legal problems.""
Bragg's election interference theory is ""weak,"" Shugerman wrote. ""As a reality check, it is legal for a candidate to pay for a nondisclosure agreement.""

TRUMP SAYS CRIMINAL TRIAL IS HAVING 'REVERSE EFFECT' AS HE CAMPAIGNS AT NEW YORK BODEGA, VOWS TO SAVE CITY
Shugerman also raised three problems with Bragg's effort to try a federal crime in a state court. The first, he wrote, was that there was no previous case of ""any state prosecutor relying on the Federal Election Campaign Act,"" which he called an ""overreach.""
The second issue he raised was that the prosecutors didn't cite judicial precedents involving the criminal statute at hand.
""Mr. Trump’s lawyers argued that the New York statute requires that the predicate (underlying) crime must also be a New York crime, not a crime in another jurisdiction. The Manhattan DA responded with judicial precedents only about other criminal statutes, not the statute in this case. In the end, they could not cite a single judicial interpretation of this particular statute supporting their use of the statute,"" Shugerman wrote.
The third problem was that precedent in New York did not allow ""an interpretation of defrauding the general public,"" Shugerman wrote.

Shugerman said it was reasonable to question whether the case against Trump was about ""Manhattan politics"" rather than New York law.
""This case is still an embarrassment of prosecutorial ethics and apparent selective prosecution,"" Shugerman concluded, adding that Trump could win in appellate courts if he is convicted. ""But if Monday’s opening is a preview of exaggerated allegations, imprecise legal theories and persistently unaddressed problems, the prosecutors might not win a conviction at all.""

CEO announces plans to move software giant's world headquarters to red state,"UBS managing director Jason Katz and Interactive Brokers strategist Steve Sosnick reveal how investors can navigate conflicting messages in the stock market on 'The Claman Countdown.'
Oracle founder Larry Ellison announced Tuesday that he plans to move the software giant’s corporate headquarters to Nashville, Tennessee, which he added is at the center of the healthcare industry.
Ellison sat down with former Senate majority leader Bill Frist for an onstage conversation in Nashville, which was shared by Oracle Health on the social media platform LinkedIn on Tuesday.
The founder and executive chairman told Frist his company was moving its ""huge campus"" to Nashville, and it will ""ultimately be our world headquarters.""
""I shouldn’t have said that,"" Ellison quickly said, but there was no turning back because he disclosed information on his company’s future.

Ellison said Oracle’s move to Nashville will position his company as one of the major players in the healthcare industry, an industry Oracle is looking to expand its position in.
Back in 2022, Oracle acquired Cerner for $28 billion. The Kansas City, Missouri-based company provides software for managing electronic health records.
As Ellison elaborated on the company’s plans to move, he said Nashville is ""a fabulous place to live.""

He also said Nashville is ""the center of the industry we’re most concerned about, which is the healthcare industry.""

The CEO said the new campus will not look anything like a corporate campus, but instead it will be a park with buildings on it.
Ellison said the news site will have office buildings, a community clinic, restaurants, hotels and a concert venue — a floating stage on the lake for concerts to be held for the community.

"Grandma accused of killing Kansas moms bought 5 tasers, searched 'pain level,' docs say","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A grandmother accused of killing two Kansas women amid a child custody battle searched ""taser pain level"" and other phrases that give insight into the women's horrific deaths, court documents reveal.
Grandmother Tifany Machel Adams, 54, her boyfriend, Tad Bert Cullum, and married couple Cole and Cora Twombly all face two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of kidnapping and one count of conspiracy to commit murder in the deaths of 27-year-old mother Veronica Butler and visitation supervisor Jilian Kelley, a 38-year-old preacher's wife who was also a mother.
The four belonged to a religiously affiliated anti-government group called ""God's Misfits,"" Fox News Digital previously reported.
Their motive, investigators say, was to get custody of Butler's two children. Wrangler Rickman, Adams' son, had custody of the children but was confirmed to be in an Oklahoma rehab facility when the women disappeared. Butler was allowed supervised visitation with her children every Saturday and was likely to be granted unsupervised visitation during an upcoming hearing, per court documents.
Butler and Kelley were last seen alive on March 30 as they set off from Hugoton, Kansas, to a court-supervised visit with Butler's two children in Oklahoma.

When the pair never brought Butler's daughter to a birthday party as planned, Butler's family set off to look for the two women.
They found Butler's car on the border between Kansas and Oklahoma with ""evidence in and around the vehicle that indicated a severe injury,"" including blood on the road and Butler's glasses on the ground near a broken hammer.
A pistol magazine was found in Kelley's purse at the scene, investigators wrote, but the pistol was nowhere to be found, according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by Fox News Digital.
Interviews with the Twombly's 16-year-old and a review of Adams' phone and data from three burner phones led investigators to find the women's bodies on April 14 in a cow pasture leased by Cullum, court documents show.

Adams told police that Butler and Rickman's children were staying the night with family friends on March 29 and that Butler had canceled her visitation with the children on the morning of March 30. But Butler's phone records indicated that although she did call Adams, she was in the process of picking up Kelley for the visit. Kelley was Butler's preferred supervisor for visitations, investigators wrote.
Rickman's grandmother, Debi Knox-Davis, reported to police that the father of the children told her their family wouldn't have to worry about their custody battle with Butler for much longer, per court documents. He told her Adams ""knew the path the judge walked to work,"" she told police, and that they planned to ""take out Veronica at drop off (sic).""
The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) obtained a warrant to search Adams' phone on April 1. Searches performed on the device allegedly included ""taser pain level,"" gun shops, prepaid cellular phones and ""how to get someone out of [your] house.""

A search of local gun shops later showed that Adams had purchased five stun guns on March 23.
On April 3, the Twombly couple's daughter reportedly told police that she was told her parents, Adams and Cullum were responsible for Butler and Kelley's deaths. Adams had provided the other three with burner phones, she said, so they could communicate discreetly about their plans.
Before the women were last seen on March 30, the 16-year-old reportedly said she'd overheard conversations between the four suspects about how ""Butler [was] not protecting her children from her brother ... in reference to a sexual abuse allegation.""

The 16-year-old said her parents told her they would ""not have to worry about [Butler] again"" and that the two may have been placed in a well, per court documents.
""[The 16-year-old] asked why [Kelley] had to die and was told by Cora that [Kelley] wasn't innocent either, as she had supported Butler,"" investigators wrote.

The group's plan was initially to ""throw an anvil through Butler's windshield while driving, making it look like an accident because anvils regularly fall off work vehicles,"" Cora allegedly told the 16-year-old.
The minor reportedly named a fifth party who was involved in planning the women's deaths but who has yet to be arrested.
OSBI investigators found records that Adams had purchased the three prepaid cellphones. Tracing the previous locations of the phones led detectives to ""fresh dirt work"" covered with hay, where the women's bodies were found, according to authorities.
Although the women's bodies and causes of death are pending a medical examiner's report, OSBI said, there is ""no chance"" Butler and Kelley are still alive.
""This case is tragic,"" OSBI spokesperson Hunter McKee told KFDA. ""You have two people who are dead and four people who committed an absolutely brutal crime.""

Lionel Richie has one superstar in mind to replace Katy Perry on 'American Idol',"Luke Bryan expands on his future with ""American Idol"" and if he thinks fans have been too critical of Katy Perry this past season.
With Katy Perry's ""American Idol"" exit drawing closer and closer, her fellow judges are weighing in on what they'll miss most about the ""Roar"" singer and who they think should take her seat on the judges' panel.
Speaking to Fox News Digital at the ""American Idol"" Top 10 Tastemaker event in Los Angeles on Monday, Lionel Richie recalled the moment he knew the dynamic between him, Perry and fellow judge Luke Bryan was something special.
""Katy's great,"" said Richie. ""The first season, she made me turn into my mom and dad and grandma so fast, ‘Like what are you doing? You can't do that in public.' Everything that was adult came out of me. I realized this lady was out of control. Then Luke would come in and say some stuff. Then I started thinking about my reputation. But then we got to the point where it settled in, I became papa bear and I have the children.""
'AMERICAN IDOL' AUDIENCE BOOS KATY PERRY FOR ANOTHER QUESTIONABLE CRITIQUE
In February, Katy Perry announced this would be her last season as a judge on ""American Idol."" (Disney/Eric McCandless/Getty Images)
""I'm going to miss her. Finding someone who has that sense of humor, it's going to be tough,"" he added.
While there's no replacing Perry, Richie does have one person he'd like to see step into her role: Taylor Swift.
""Taylor Swift, if you're listening out there, this is a wonderful place to stay,"" he said. ""Luke and I would love to have you join us.""

In February, Perry — who began serving as a judge on ""American Idol"" during its sixteenth season in 2018 — announced her plans to leave the singing competition once the current season concludes.
""I think this probably will be my last show, my last season for ‘Idol,’"" Perry announced on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live.""

""I mean, I love ‘Idol’ so much… It’s connected me with the heart of America, but I feel like I need to go out and feel that pulse to my own beat,"" she added as she winked at the host.
While Bryan admitted he had a certain perception of who Perry was before starting the show, he's grown to know the real her and loves the friendship they've built over the past seven years.

""I'm going to miss just how mine and her personalities really gel,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""There's no stress in mine and her delivery on the show. Last night, me and her combatively went at each other, and then we don't even worry about it. Some people take that stuff and go, 'Well you upstaged me on TV.’ Not in seven years have we ever had those moments where we were trying to outshine each other's stardom or step on each other's toes. We just really had fun and tried to rebrand the show into something that a lot of people want to huddle up and watch.""

""Going into this show I had a perception of Katy Perry,"" he added. ""Leaving this show, the beauty of Katy is, she is who she is. We've had so many amazing talks through the years. All of our differences and everything, it's always been how great conversations should go. I would tell her stuff that would enlighten her, and she would enlighten me on something that I didn't know about.""
""We've grown as friends. Me and Lionel have been there throughout her motherhood,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to her going out and her doing what she wants to do, but I'm also looking forward to reuniting somewhere [down the line] where we can visit and catch up.""
Longtime host Ryan Seacrest shared Bryan's sentiment.
""She's brought an amazing generosity, love, big heart and that kind of spirit to the show,"" he said. ""Whoever comes in we hope they'll have that same kind of impact.""

As for Perry, besides missing her fellow judges, she said she's going to miss the inspiring stories and the resilience she sees in the contestants every season.
""I'm going to miss the storytelling, the inspiring backgrounds of all these kids, the struggle that they go through, the hope they find,"" Perry told Fox News Digital. ""I'm going to miss watching them bloom and blossom. I'm going to miss them finding their conference. I'm going to miss how they inspire me. Hearing them and seeing their resilience is incredible.""

With the ""Idol"" season finale around the corner, the question of who will be stepping in for Perry comes up more often than not.
During an interview with E! News last week, Perry said that she enjoyed having country music sensation Jelly Roll on the show and would love to see him sit alongside Richie and Bryan.

""I gotta say, Jelly Roll was crazy when he came on the show,"" she told the outlet. ""I was convinced at anything he said. He could run for president. He could be my pastor. I might go back to church for him. He could sell me anything.""
""To have any of these guys plus Jelly on the show would be amazing. I love you, Jelly!"" she said.

Shocking photos show farmhouse dangling off edge of cliff,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
An 18th century farmhouse can be seen hanging perilously over a cliff edge — which has been eroded away along a coast in the U.K.
The old farmhouse at Cliff Farm in Trimingham, Norfolk, England, can be seen dangling over the cliff in a precarious position after the land slipped away at the beginning of the month.
The three-bedroom home was bought at auction five years ago for £132,000 (roughly $164,000 in U.S. dollars) — and one photo shows the extent of the coastal erosion over the years, as SWNS reported.

Earlier, the farmhouse sat further away from the cliff, but recent landslips have left the back part of the home exposed, the same source noted.
The North Norfolk District Council said it would demolish the property in the days ahead before it falls onto the beach — and the homeowner has evacuated, SWNS said.

Harry Blathwayt, North Norfolk District Council’s portfolio holder for the coast, said previously, ""It’s very sad that the old farmhouse has been undermined by landfall over the last few weeks. Sadly, it will have to be demolished.""
""The building is in a precarious position, to say the least.""
He added, ""The owner of the property has spoken to council officers, and he fully accepts that the building is in a precarious position, to say the least.""
As a result, contractors will be ""taking it down"" before it falls onto the beach.

""Erosion at Trimingham has been happening at an alarming rate due to heavy rainfall over the winter, which has saturated the soft cliffs, leading to frequent landslides,"" said SWNS.
It reported that in January 2020, the cliff fell at Trimingham overnight.

Keith Olbermann demands ESPN 'fire' Stephen A. Smith for not criticizing Trump,"Keith Olbermann offered ESPN an ultimatum: silence Stephen A. Smith or fire him.
Olbermann uploaded a video detailing his orders Monday, including a meandering 393-word caption. In short, he called upon ESPN to take immediate action after Smith appeared on Fox News last week.
""WHY ESPN MUST EITHER SILENCE OR FIRE STEPHEN A. SMITH: Its longstanding policy - no, you can't be a sportscaster on one station and an advocate for a presidential candidate on another station - is right. I know: I helped to author it because the day when you (or I) could straddle both worlds is long gone,"" started Olbermann.
For background, Sean Hannity asked Smith about polls demonstrating the growing support for Trump among black voters. Smith attributed the trend to black Americans relating to how the law has been weaponized against the former president.
""By Donald Trump’s statement weeks ago, talking about how he’s hearing that black folks find him relatable, because what he’s going through is similar to what black Americans have gone through. He wasn’t lying,"" Smith told Sean Hannity.
""He was telling the truth. When you see the law enforcement, the court system, and everything else being exercised against him, it is something that black folks, throughout this nation, can relate to.""
You can watch the segment below:
There's a lot here.
Let us take it step-by-step:
Firstly, you are likely wondering at what point during the segment Smith ""endorsed,"" as Olbermann stated, Donald Trump. Here's the catch: he never did.
In fact, Smith is open about neither supporting Trump nor planning to vote for him.
He simply answered the question Hannity posed with analysis supported by polling. Anyway, Olbermann wants him fired for that.
Secondly, ESPN allows Smith to discuss politics on Fox News (and other cable news networks, like CNN) because he negotiated a clause in his contract that allows him to operate a political/cultural podcast outside of ESPN. In doing so, Smith bypasses ESPN's standard booking restrictions.
Olbermann didn't have that clause in his contract during his several stints at ESPN. Most commentators don't. Stephen A. Smith does because he has leverage over ESPN, as the biggest drawing card at the company.
Notice below the logo behind Smith during his appearance on Fox News. Notice how the chyron reads ""Host of the Stephen A. Smith Show"" and not ""ESPN Host.""
Thirdly, Olbermann promises that he'd insist on the same ultimatum if Smith ""were campaigning for Biden."" Hmm.
So how come Olbermann didn't call for Stephen A's job when he appeared on Chris Cuomo's NewsNation program last month and criticized Trump?
Likewise, Olbermann had little to say when ESPN contributor Pablo Torre mocked then-Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy on MSNBC late last year.
KO only screeches about ESPN's tolerance for political discourse when it involves Sage Steele (a moderate conservative) or Smith (who, occasionally, departs from the pre-approved liberal orthodoxy).
Lastly, there was a time when Olbermann could inflict real damage on one's career. He could force the hand of a network. He was influential enough to incite pressure campaigns against a preferred target.
That is the case no longer.
Keith Olbermann is washed. His audience is diminished. He's an ally of no one important.
Look at him and try not to laugh:
Per the poll: he's nuts.
Oh, and don't expect ESPN to silence or fire Stephen A.

Far-left Democrat fights off primary challenge in battleground state,"Fox News' Bryan Llenas explains the 'uncommitted' threat facing President Biden as Pennsylvania primary voters head to polls.
A member of the far-left ""Squad"" survived a challenge from a centrist Democrat on Tuesday despite her sharp criticism of Israel that threatened her effort to win re-election in a district with a sizable Jewish community.
Rep. Summer Lee, a first-term congresswoman, will once again be the Democrat nominee to represent Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, after defeating local councilwoman Bhavini Patel.
Lee's victory follows that of fellow ""Squad"" member Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., in 2022, when she was nearly ousted in her own primary after making controversial remarks about police and Israel throughout her political career.

The race was viewed as an early test of how progressive Democrats critical of Israel might perform with voters as the party faces a continued divide over support for one of America's closest allies in the Middle East amid continued Gaza military operations in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack.
Since the attack and the war's escalation, Lee had called for a ceasefire and opposed sending more funding to Israel.
She had come under fire in recent months from pro-Israel groups and the Jewish community for her rhetoric on the war, including an open letter signed by dozens of rabbis condemning her ""divisive rhetoric"" they said had been ""perceived as openly antisemitic.""

While campaigning, Patel framed Lee's anti-Israel stance as part of a left-wing politics too extreme for the people of the district, and argued it ran in contrast to President Biden's agenda as he faces his own challenge of winning Pennsylvania against former President Donald Trump in November.
The issue of antisemitism was a particularly potent issue in the 12th district because it is home to the synagogue where a gunman killed 11 congregants in 2018, the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.

Lee's victory helped her avoid being the first House Democrat incumbent to lose a primary this year. Other ""Squad"" members are also expected to face tough primary challenges from centrist Democrats, including Reps. Cori Bush, D-Mo., Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.

Lawmakers seek answers from Mayorkas after cyberattacks on water systems in US,"'State Armor' founder & CEO Michael Lucci joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how Chinese hackers are targeting American infrastructure and what can be done to mitigate the threat.
Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle concerned about recent cyberattacks on water systems in drought-stricken areas of the western U.S. are seeking answers from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on how hacks are going to be prevented in the future.
In a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Reps. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., and Pat Fallon, R-Texas, called for a briefing and answers regarding the January cyberattack launched against the water system in Muleshoe, Texas.
The hack caused the small Texas town’s water system to overflow, and, within two hours, sent tens of thousands of gallons of water flowing out of the town’s water tower.
The attack was one of three on small towns in the rural Texas Panhandle linked to a Russian hacktivist group.
RURAL TEXAS TOWNS REPORT CYBERATTACKS THAT CAUSED ONE WATER SYSTEM TO OVERFLOW

According to Mike Cypert, the city manager of Hale Center, there were about 37,000 attempts in four days to log into the city’s firewall. Ultimately, the attempted hack failed as the city ""unplugged"" the system and operated it manually.
But in Muleshoe, which has a population of about 5,000, hackers caused the system to overflow before it was shut down and taken over manually by city officials.
In the letter to Mayorkas, the legislators said the cybersecurity firm Mandiant attributed the attack to Sandworm, which is believed to be connected to Russia’s spy agency, the GRU.

In 2018, Sandworm launched hacks against the Olympic Games in South Korea and on Ukraine’s electrical grid.
Another group connected to Sandworm, the Cyber Army of Russia Reborn, claimed responsibility for the hack in Texas, the lawmakers wrote.
""Water facilities continue to be central to our nation’s critical infrastructure, and our water resources face many limitations,"" Gallego and Fallon said. ""Should a hack similar to the Texas incident occur in Arizona or other states that may lack sufficient water supply, it could disrupt operations across the region with devastating effects.""

They added that losing tens of thousands of gallons of water, like Muleshoe did in January, could have ""devastating impacts"" on rural communities across the country.
The two lawmakers sent a list of questions to Mayorkas, asking what actions his department is taking to respond to the hack against Muleshoe’s water system, what steps he is taking to protect the nation’s water facilities and other critical infrastructure from disruption and what lessons his department has learned from previous hacks, pointing to an incident last year when an Iranian regime-linked cyber group conducted a hack against a water authority in Pennsylvania.
The letter marks the second time since December of last year that Gallego has requested a briefing from Mayorkas about DHS protection of U.S. water facilities and other critical infrastructure from adversary disruption.
Fox News Digital reached out to DHS for comment and did not immediately hear back.

In March, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael S. Regan and Jake Sullivan, assistant to the president for National Security Affairs, sent a letter to the nation’s governors asking them to take steps to protect the water supply, including assessing cybersecurity and planning for a cyberattack.
""Drinking water and wastewater systems are an attractive target for cyberattacks because they are a lifeline critical infrastructure sector but often lack the resources and technical capacity to adopt rigorous cybersecurity practices,"" Regan and Sullivan wrote.

Crucial Senate showdown in key battleground state underway,"'Fox & Friends Weekend' co-hosts go 'off the wall' to break down the upcoming 2024 election calendar and preview key dates and battleground races.
It's officially game on in Pennsylvania, as Republican candidate Dave McCormick and Democratic Sen. Bob Casey Jr. were projected the winners of the two major party Senate primaries in the northeastern battleground state.
Both candidates, who were unopposed in Tuesday's Democratic and GOP primaries, will now face off in a high-profile and expensive Senate showdown that is one of a handful across the country which will likely decide whether the GOP wins back the Senate majority.
McCormick, a former hedge fund executive, West Point graduate, Gulf War combat veteran and Treasury Department official in former President George W. Bush’s administration, is making his second straight bid for the Senate.
HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS ELECTION RESULTS

He was part of a crowded and combustible battle for the 2022 GOP nomination. He ended up losing the nomination by a razor-thin margin to celebrity doctor and cardiac surgeon Mehmet Oz, who secured a primary victory thanks to a late endorsement from former President Donald Trump. Oz ended up losing the general election to then-Democrat Lt. Gov. John Fetterman.
This time around, McCormick faced no major opposition in the GOP primary. He was backed last year by longtime Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell as well as the Pennsylvania GOP, and was encouraged to run by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is the party's Senate campaign arm.
TRUMP MAKES MAJOR ENDORSEMENT IN KEY SENATE RACE
McCormick endorsed Trump early last month after the former president scored major victories in the coast to coast Super Tuesday contests and Nikki Haley – Trump's last remaining rival for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination – dropped out of the White House race.
Trump, the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, returned the favor earlier this month, endorsing McCormick.

Casey, the son of a popular former governor, is running for a fourth six-year term in the Senate. He served a decade as Pennsylvania's auditor general and then treasurer before winning election to the Senate in 2006.

The most recent public opinion polls indicate Casey holding a single-digit advantage over McCormick.
Democrats currently control the U.S. Senate with a 51-49 majority, but Republicans are looking at a favorable Senate map this year, with Democrats defending 23 of the 34 seats up for grabs.
Three of those seats are in red states that Trump carried in his 2020 election defeat to President Biden — Ohio, Montana and West Virginia, where Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin is not running for re-election. And Pennsylvania is one of five key general election battlegrounds where the Democrats are defending seats. Democrats may also have to worry about holding the open Senate seat in blue Maryland, where former GOP Gov. Larry Hogan is running.

Celebrity trainer details 'irrefutable evidence' in trans athlete debate,"The celebrity fitness trainer joins ""Fox & Friends"" to discuss West Virginia middle school students protesting a transgender athlete and to give her take on America's obesity crisis.
Celebrity fitness trainer Jillian Michaels spoke out Tuesday in favor of fairness in women's sports after several middle school students in West Virginia staged a protest against one of their competitors, a natural-born male.
Michaels said the data supporting men's strength as superior to women is ""irrefutable"" during ""Fox & Friends,"" even when accounting for cross-sex hormone therapy.

""You've got two competing goals in sports. … One is inclusion, which everybody can understand and get on board with. However, the second goal that's in direct opposition with inclusion in this instance is going to be a fair competition,"" Michaels said on Tuesday.
""And if that's your priority, if your overriding priority is going to be fairness over inclusion, you've got to turn to the data, and the data irrefutably shows that biological males are 10 to 30% stronger, faster, have better endurance, better aerobic capacity across the board.""
At least five middle school girls refused to compete at the Harrison County Championships track meet last week after a transgender female won her shot put competition by three feet, according to the New York Post.
The 13-year-old won the competition despite five girls from a rival school refusing to throw in protest of her participation.

The protest comes after a federal appeals court ruled that transgender girls could not be barred from competing in West Virginia.
""If we defer to the studies, and I sent several to your producers … they show that even on puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, the decrease in physical performance is, quote, trivial. That's what the data says,"" Michaels said.
""And to give you an example, if you look at a biological male transgender female with grip strength in conjunction with a biological female transgender male – OK, so both of them are on blockers and cross-sex hormones – the transgender female, the biological male's grip strength was 17% greater than the female on testosterone and puberty blockers,"" she continued.
The eighth-grader reportedly takes puberty blockers and has identified as female for years.

OutKick host Charly Arnolt praised the girls for refusing to compete, saying their stance is the only way to spark change and protect fairness in women's sports.
""It's really upsetting that these middle school girls have to forfeit their opportunities in order to take a stand,"" Arnolt said earlier during ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday. ""That takes a lot of courage, especially at that age, but they're doing this for the greater good. It's not just for themselves.""
""These girls decided, ‘You know what? We want to make sure that people are paying attention.’ This is the only way and the only way for … the government to really start paying attention, and especially that federal appeals court that just struck down the law in West Virginia that bans transgender athletes from competing in female sports,"" she continued.
""It's the only way they're going to start saying, ‘OK, maybe we are doing something incorrectly here.’""

"Snakebite victims need to stop bringing in serpents, hospital demands","Five tammar wallaby joeys were seen hanging out in their new habitat at the Perth Zoo in Australia. Originally orphaned and found on Garden Island, the group is now being carefully watched by zoo staff. See them thrive!
An Australian hospital urged snakebite victims to stop trying to catch the slithery culprits when seeking medical attention after one patient came in carrying a serpent in a loosely locked box.
""We honestly don't want people interacting with snakes any more than they already have,"" Dr. Adam Michael, director of emergency medicine at Bundaberg Hospital near Brisbane, told the Australian Broadcast Company. ""Any attempts to either get close to a snake to catch or to kill, or to photograph the snake, just puts people at risk.""
About 3,000 people suffer suspected snakebites each year in Australia, according to the National Institutes of Health. Only between 100 and 200 cases end up requiring anti-venom.

He also cited examples of patients bringing in snakes contained in plastic bags and even less-secured plastic containers. The hospital then had to pay for the snakes to be relocated to the wild.

""We want people to be able to get seen and assessed quickly and having a live snake in the department slows up that process,"" Michael said, assuring that doctors do not need to see and identify the snake in order to treat poisonous bites.

""We can determine if you need anti-venom and if so, what anti-venom you need based on clinical signs, blood tests and also the snake venom detection kits that we keep here at the hospital,"" Michael stressed. ""We're actually not trained to identify snakes, and so it's not helpful. It just puts the staff at risk as well as yourself.""

Instead, Michael asked patients to focus on their wound and receiving treatment: Stay calm, avoid cleaning the affected area and apply firm pressure while seeking medical attention as soon as possible, according to The Guardian.

The Wide Bay Hospital & Health Service, which oversees operations of the Bundaberg Hospital, posted further guidelines on Facebook: Avoid washing the area, firmly bandage it, immobilize the limb to slow the spread of venom, mark the bandage to show where the bite is and continue to hold pressure – tight enough to slow the spread but not enough to cut off circulation.

""Applying a tourniquet, cutting the wound, sucking the venom or bringing the snake with you to emergency are not recommended,"" the post warned. ""We understand that being bitten by a snake is scary, but all facilities across our health service hold stocks of polyvalent and are well-prepared to treat snake bites.""

Predicting whether you're a Democrat or Republican based on your looks? It's a new reality,"Rep. Jay Obernolte was selected to lead the House task force on AI. Fox News Digital speaks with the California Republican about his goals for the panel and his own thoughts about the rapidly advancing technology.
Researchers are warning that facial recognition technologies are ""more threatening than previously thought"" and pose ""serious challenges to privacy"" after a study found that artificial intelligence can be successful in predicting a person’s political orientation based on images of expressionless faces.
A recent study published in the journal American Psychologist says an algorithm’s ability to accurately guess one’s political views is ""on par with how well job interviews predict job success, or alcohol drives aggressiveness."" Lead author Michal Kosinski told Fox News Digital that 591 participants filled out a political orientation questionnaire before the AI captured what he described as a numerical ""fingerprint"" of their faces and compared them to a database of their responses to predict their views.
""I think that people don’t realize how much they expose by simply putting a picture out there,"" said Kosinski, an associate professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business.
""We know that people’s sexual orientation, political orientation, religious views should be protected. It used to be different. In the past, you could enter anybody’s Facebook account and see, for example, their political views, the likes, the pages they follow. But many years ago, Facebook closed this because it was clear for policymakers and Facebook and journalists that it is just not acceptable. It’s too dangerous,"" he continued.
GOOGLE CONSOLIDATES AI-FOCUSED DEEPMIND, RESEARCH TEAMS
The study used AI to predict people's political orientation based on images of expressionless faces.
""But you can still go to Facebook and see anybody’s picture. This person never met you, they never allowed you to look at a picture, they would never share their political orientation ... and yet, Facebook shows you their picture, and what our study shows is that this is essentially to some extent the equivalent to just telling you what their political orientation is,"" Kosinski added.
For the study, the authors said the images of the participants were collected in a highly controlled manner.
""Participants wore a black T-shirt adjusted using binder clips to cover their clothes. They removed all jewelry and – if necessary – shaved facial hair. Face wipes were used to remove cosmetics until no residues were detected on a fresh wipe. Their hair was pulled back using hair ties, hair pins, and a headband while taking care to avoid flyaway hairs,"" they wrote.
The facial recognition algorithm VGGFace2 then examined the images to determine ""face descriptors, or a numerical vector that is both unique to that individual and consistent across their different images,"" it said.

""Descriptors extracted from a given image are compared to those stored in a database. If they are similar enough, the faces are considered a match. Here, we use a linear regression to map face descriptors on a political orientation scale and then use this mapping to predict political orientation for a previously unseen face,"" the study also said.
The authors wrote that their findings ""underscore the urgency for scholars, the public, and policymakers to recognize and address the potential risks of facial recognition technology to personal privacy"" and that an ""analysis of facial features associated with political orientation revealed that conservatives tended to have larger lower faces.""
""Perhaps most crucially, our findings suggest that widespread biometric surveillance technologies are more threatening than previously thought,"" the study warned. ""Previous research showed that naturalistic facial images convey information about political orientation and other intimate traits.  But it was unclear whether the predictions were enabled by self-presentation, stable facial features, or both. Our results, suggesting that stable facial features convey a substantial amount of the signal, imply that individuals have less control over their privacy.""
Kosinski told Fox News Digital that ""algorithms can be very easily applied to millions of people very quickly and cheaply"" and that the study is ""more of a warning tale"" about the technology ""that is in your phone and is very widely used everywhere.""

The authors concluded that ""even crude estimates of people’s character traits can significantly improve the efficiency of online mass persuasion campaigns"" and that ""scholars, the public, and policymakers should take notice and consider tightening policies regulating the recording and processing of facial images.""

"North Korea issues nuclear 'warning signal' to US, South Korea","Korth Korean leader Kim Jong Un views a simulated nuclear counter attack drill. (Credit: Associated Press)
North Korea’s missile test on Monday was in fact a drill to test nuclear force preparedness, according to local media.
The incident raised alarms around the region after several short-range ballistic missiles were launched near Pyongyang and flew approximately 185 miles before falling in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
The drill’s main purpose, however, was to ""demonstrate the reliability, superiority, might and diverse means"" of the country’s nuclear forces and the Haekbangashoe system that serves as ""a clear warning signal to the enemies"" of North Korea, according to the Pyongyang Times.
The Haekbangashoe system, which means ""nuclear trigger,"" included the maneuver of troops into a ""counterattack posture"" that aimed at ""substantially strengthening the prompt counterattack capacity of the state nuclear force.""

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reportedly oversaw the drill, which occurred as the U.S. and South Korea started a combined joint formation drill at Kunsan Air Base, which commenced on April 12 and is expected to end April 26. He reportedly likened the weapon system to ""the firing of a sniper’s rifle.""
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff claimed that any reports of such accuracy or capabilities of its weapons system were likely exaggerated, and that South Korea’s military could detect and intercept any weapons.

To combat North Korea’s aggressive pursuit of nuclear preparedness, Washington, Tokyo and Seoul agreed to a system of real-time missile data-sharing, which would allow the three countries to monitor Pyongyang’s launches, according to Newsweek.
U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said the launch ""does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory, or to our allies,"" stressing instead the ""destabilizing impact of the DPRK’s illicit weapons program.""

Texas Supreme Court orders county to not pay under guaranteed income program,"Republican State Sen. Brandon Creighton discusses the law he authored to close DEI departments at public universities.
The Supreme Court of Texas issued a ruling Tuesday that prohibits Harris County from launching a guaranteed income program which is currently being disputed by Attorney General Ken Paxton.
The decision comes just days after Houston County Judge Ursula Hall struck down Paxton’s arguments that the Uplift Harris program, which distributes monthly stipends to over 1,900 low-income residents, is unconstitutional.
""If the program does include a public benefit, it does not violate the constitution,"" the Houston Landing reported Hall as saying.
Paxton’s attorneys argued that taxpayer money must be used in the public interest for a general benefit.

The Harris County Commissioners Court passed Uplift Harris last year by a vote of 4-1.
The guaranteed income pilot would allow participating households to receive $500 per month for 18 months. The program began on Jan. 12, and currently has 1,924 applicants enrolled.
Paxton filed a lawsuit seeking an immediate ruling to block Uplift Harris from making payments under the program, which the Texas Supreme Court granted.
""Without regard to the merits, the court grants an administrative stay as follows: Real parties in interest and their agents are prohibited from making payments under the Uplift Harris program pending further order of this Court,"" the ruling read.

UpTogether, an organization with a mission of investing in people in historically undervalued communities by influencing policies and mobilizing systems for change, responded to the court’s ruling on Tuesday, calling the decision ""shameful.""
""Today’s shameful decision means thousands of Texas residents facing financial hardship will be denied an opportunity for financial stability and upward mobility for the unforeseeable future,"" UpTogether CEO Jesús Gerena said. ""By blocking Uplift Harris, the state Supreme Court has tossed aside any notion of judicial restraint and joined Ken Paxton’s ongoing circus show, in which he continues to use people’s day-to-day survival as a political football.""
Gerena added that what Paxton was doing ""is cruel, it is deceitful, and it is opportunistic.""
Still, Paxton continues to fight against what he says is unconstitutional.

""I’m pleased the Supreme Court of Texas has blocked Harris County from disbursing these unlawful payments,"" Paxton said. ""I look forward to continuing to defend our Constitution and preventing this egregious misuse of taxpayer money.""
Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said in February that migrants are living in poverty, ""supporting them helps all of us and has good downstream effects on all of us.""
After hearing the news that payments would not be able to go out immediately, she said her heart ""breaks"" for the families.

""This is the state once again trying to bully Harris County, and these families are getting caught in the middle,"" Hidalgo said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""The Attorney General has known for a year that we had this program coming, so we really were surprised to see them try to block it once we had already selected and notified the recipients. I’ve already heard stories of people who were expecting these funds and I hate having to give them contradictory information every day, but I can say that we are going to keep fighting.""
Harris County has until April 29 to respond to the emergency motion for relief to the Texas Supreme Court.

State lawmakers move closer to allowing teachers to carry firearms in classrooms,"Fox News co-host Pete Hegseth has the latest on Nashville police department confirming it will release the trans shooter manifesto on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'
Tennessee lawmakers overwhelmingly passed a GOP-backed bill on Tuesday that will allow schoolteachers to carry firearms on school grounds, though the names of the armed instructors would not be published to the public.
Earlier this month, Republican lawmakers in Tennessee joined together to approve Senate Bill 1325 with a 26-5 vote. The bill allows a teacher or faculty member who meets certain requirements, to possess and carry a firearm on school grounds.
In order to carry a handgun, teachers must have a handgun carry permit, have written authorization from both the school’s principal and local law enforcement and undergo 40 hours of handgun training. The worker must also not be prohibited from purchasing, possessing and carrying a handgun under Tennessee or federal law, as determined by a background check.
On Tuesday, the House in the state Legislature continued to push the bill closer to becoming law by passing the sister bill by a 68-28 vote. It now heads to Gov. Bill Lee’s desk to be signed into law.
TENNESSEE LAWMAKERS PASS BILL ALLOWING TEACHERS TO CARRY GUNS AT SCHOOL 1 YEAR AFTER DEADLY NASHVILLE SHOOTING

Last year, a fatal shooting at The Covenant School, a private Christian elementary school in Nashville, left three children and three adults dead.
The state Senate’s approval of the bill sparked outcries from teachers, students, Democratic lawmakers and even Covenant School parents.
On Tuesday, protesters screamed, ""Blood on your hands,"" before House speaker Cameron Sexton called for state troopers to remove them from the balcony, FOX 17 in Nashville reported.

Rep. Justin Jones, D-Nashville, called the bill ""morally insane.""
""Republicans continue to hold our state hostage,"" he reportedly said. ""God have mercy on you that you do not hear the pain of these mothers saying to protect kids, not guns.""
One of the sponsors of the bill, Sen. Paul Bailey, said the bill allows staff and faculty to carry arms if they choose to, but in order to carry a gun, they must go through 40 hours of training and undergo a psychological evaluation.
Rep. Ryan Williams, another sponsor of the bill, said the standards teachers must meet in order to carry in a Tennessee school will be ""very high.""
The law is considered ""100% permissive,"" according to Williams, and is up to school districts to implement. Approval also falls on law enforcement and school administrators.

Williams also said the bill is intended to be a deterrent, adding the identities of teachers carrying guns would not be released.
Still, Rep. Jason Powell, a Democrat from Nashville, said the law ""makes me sick to my stomach,"" adding it is dangerous.
""It’s going to have dangerous impacts around the world,"" Powell reportedly said. ""Think about law enforcement. It’s going to delay responses. It’s going to put law enforcement in danger. How will they know who’s the assailant and who’s the teacher with the gun?""

Lee did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment on the matter.
Before its passage, the bill’s proponents argued teachers and faculty could serve as a more immediate response force to a shooting situation. They said it could be particularly helpful in rural counties with limited law enforcement resources.
The contentious bill comes approximately a year after a deadly shooting last March at The Covenant School. The shooter, who was killed at the scene by police, killed three children and three adults during the rampage.
The bill also comes amid a larger push from Tennessee Republicans to loosen gun laws, including signing off on permitless carry for handguns in 2021.
The push includes an effort to expand the state’s permitless carry law to include long guns.

The original law allowed residents 21 and older to carry handguns in public without a permit. Two years later, Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti then allowed 18- to 20-year-olds to carry handguns publicly.
Lawmakers also approved a bill that would allow private schools with pre-kindergarten classes to have guns on campus. The governor has not yet signed it into law.

Arizona rancher George Alan Kelly defense says single juror blocked acquittal,"Fox News’ William La Jeunesse on where the case goes next after the mistrial.
Arizona rancher George Alan Kelly’s defense confirmed to Fox News Digital that there was ""one, lone holdout"" who wanted to convict, while the remaining jurors sought an acquittal.
Arizona Superior Court Judge Thomas Fink declared that the case ended in a mistrial on Monday, as the jurors were unable to reach a unanimous decision to convict Kelly of second-degree murder or any of the lower counts of manslaughter, negligent homicide or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Fink scheduled a 1:30 p.m. status hearing for Monday, April 29.
Fink said that the hearing next week will ""allow the state to take a look at the situation and decide whether or not it wishes to ask the court to reset the matter for trial.""
""The jury verdict was seven to acquit and one, lone holdout who was stubborn and would not listen to evidence,"" the defense team told Fox News Digital. ""All the other jurors were angry about it.""
The jury remained deadlocked after deliberating since Thursday for more than 15 hours.
""They won't wear me down,"" Kelly said at the courthouse of the potential of being tried a second time, according to AZ Central.
""I feel like I've been in suspension for 15 months, and I'm getting nowhere, and I'm still on that treadmill. We have to wait a little longer,"" Kelly's wife, Wanda Kelly, added Monday, according to the outlet.
ARIZONA RANCHER DEFENSE CONSULTANT CLAIMS 'CARTEL INFLUENCE' IN MURDER PROBE, RIPS SHERIFF'S PAST COMMENTS
Fox News Digital reached out to Santa Cruz County District Attorney George Silva's office on Tuesday but did not immediately hear back.

Kelly’s defense attorney, Brenna Larkin, said in her closing argument last week that evidence did not support the prosecution’s claim that the deceased, Mexican national Gabriel Cuen-Buitimea, was an ""unarmed migrant pursuing the American Dream"" before he was found shot to death on Kelly's 170-acre cattle ranch near Keno Springs outside Nogales, Arizona, on Jan. 30, 2023.
The defense claimed that prosecutors failed to prove that Cuen-Buitimea was shot by Kelly's gun. The defense maintained that Kelly only fired warning shots into the air from his patio earlier that day, and Wanda Kelly testified about dialing their Border Patrol ranch liaison upon spotting two armed men dressed in camouflage and carrying rifles and backpacks walking about 100 feet from their home. Law enforcement responded to the property, and hours passed before Kelly called Border Patrol again to report finding the body about 115 yards from the ranching couple's residence.
A criminologist working pro bono as a consultant for Kelly’s defense, Dr. Ron Martinelli, excoriated Santa Cruz County Sheriff David Hathaway's testimony about having crossed the border to Mexico weeks after the shooting on Kelly's ranch to interview Daniel Ramirez, a Honduran man who prosecutors claim was the sole sight witness to Cuen-Buitimea's death. Larkin said, based on Ramirez's own testimony, he was not there.
Ramirez testified that he formerly ran drugs across the border, though not on the day of the shooting, and had been deported several times. Additionally, the defense argued the investigation was mired by cartel influence.
Hathaway, who only recorded about six minutes of a 40-minute interview with Ramirez, was pressed about a conduit who arranged the meeting in Mexico named Juan Carlos Rodriguez.
Martinelli told Fox News Digital that the district attorney's office was forced to reveal to the defense team that Rodriguez is a twice convicted felon – the first for aggravated assault and domestic violence after strangling his girlfriend, and then he served another two years in prison ""for the transportation of weapons into the United States.""

""The Sinaloa Cartel and Malas Manos do not allow independent people to bring guns, traffic guns into the United States,"" Martinelli told Fox News Digital last week, while the jury was still deliberating.

""To me, [Hathaway] absolutely conceded to violating Mexican law and United States State Department protocols with regards to conducting an international investigation in Mexico,"" Martinelli said, referencing the sheriff's testimony. ""His whole statement and justification that he went down to Mexico to quote, 'offer his condolences to the family' is beyond belief. You know, are we to assume that that's his M.O. every time a Mexican national dies in a violent crime in Nogales that he personally takes it upon himself to go down to a foreign country to express his condolences? I mean, that's beyond the pale.""
Martinelli further took issue with the sheriff's department and the district attorney's investigator. ""Once they knew who these people were, well into this investigation, months and months ago, they continued to believe these people over two American citizens, who were law-abiding and cooperative,"" the consultant added.
The defense also pressed Hathaway on the stand about a YouTube video in which the sheriff referenced the Kelly case and claimed that the rancher wanted to ""hunt me some Mexicans.""

""Just after hearing the sheriff and seeing the video, to us, the sheriff was the moving force behind the arrest and continued prosecution of George Alan Kelly. And I believe, this is my opinion, I believe that it was to further his political designs for re-election as sheriff,"" Martinelli said last week, vowing to bring a personal complaint to the state's attorney general's office seeking an investigation into Hathaway and the sheriff's department regardless of the outcome of the case. ""Because if this was the United States Department of Justice, and we had such a grievous civil rights violations, DOJ would be on and the FBI would be on top of this in a heartbeat, and they would be looking towards what we refer to as a consent decree against this agency. This is just crazy. These people should not be having badges of authority.""
Fox News Digital reached out to the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Department about the defense consultant's allegations again on Tuesday but did not immediately hear back.
""We're not here to solve the mystery,"" Larkin said Thursday. ""And the fact is, we're probably never going to know what really happened to Gabriel. And we won't know because the investigation in this case jumped to conclusions. They didn't search when they should have. They didn't preserve evidence that they should have. They didn't do tests that they should have. And now we'll never know.""""We all live in Santa Cruz County. I live in Santa Cruz County. You folks live in Santa Cruz County,"" Larkin said. ""After reviewing all the evidence in this case, if I were to imagine finding a body on my property someday, hopefully that never happens. If I ever find a body on my property someday, and I don't know what happened, and I don't know how it got there, I think I'd be considering my options before I call these guys.""
Testimony also revealed that the fatal bullet was never recovered from the scene. Martinelli also previously told Fox News Digital that none of the state’s witnesses in the trial had provided any rebuttal testimony against the defense theory that a rip crew — a gang of bandits, sometimes cartel-affiliated — could have fatally shot Cuen-Buitimea and robbed him.

Prosecutor Mike Jette maintained in his closing argument that there was ""no justification"" to use deadly physical force upon seeing ""two unarmed men walking two fences away"" and claimed Kelly pulled out his AK-47, stepped out onto his back patio and, without any verbal warning, fired nine times. The defense said while Kelly would have been justified in using deadly physical force, the elderly rancher did not.
Larkin added that there is nothing in the law that prevents him from using lesser force to defend himself and his wife out on their isolated ranch ""in the middle of nowhere.""

A 10-year-old child woke up after his father ""hunted"" down his older brothers and mom in a disturbing murder-suicide inside a suburban Oklahoma home, police said.
Jonathon Candy, 42, had an argument with his wife, Lindsay, which spiraled out of control. He grabbed a gun and fatally shot his wife ""multiple times"" and ""systematically went through the home shooting the children,"" Oklahoma City Police Sgt. Gary Knight said.
Responding officers found the 10-year-old outside alive, but his brothers — Dylan, 18, Ethan, 14, and Lucas, 12 — were all killed before Jonathan turned the gun on himself, according to police.
""Make no mistake. What happened in that residence was nothing short of a massacre,"" Knight said during a Tuesday press conference. ""The children were hunted down and killed.""

Columbia responds after NFL owner announces he's pulling donations over antisemitism,"Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., criticizes Biden's renewable energy and spending policies, as well as anti-Israel protests surging across esteemed college campuses.
Columbia University has told FOX Business on Tuesday that it is ""grateful"" for Robert Kraft’s ""years of generosity and service"" after the New England Patriots team owner announced he is pulling financial support to his alma mater over the antisemitic protests unfolding there.
On Monday, Kraft, through a statement released by his philanthropic organization Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, said he is ""deeply saddened at the virulent hate that continues to grow on campus and throughout our country"" and that he is no longer ""comfortable supporting the university until corrective action is taken.""
When asked to respond to his remarks Tuesday, a Columbia spokesperson told FOX Business that ""Columbia is grateful to Mr. Kraft for his years of generosity and service to Columbia.""
""This is a time of crisis for many members of our community and we are focused on providing the support they need while keeping our campus safe,"" the spokesperson added.

Last week, the New York City Police Department arrested 108 protesters after they had set up an encampment on the campus lawn. On Tuesday, students at Columbia were instructed that classes have shifted to virtual or hybrid as concerns linger about campus safety stemming from the anti-Israel demonstrations.
Another top donor to Columbia, billionaire investor and Omega Advisors CEO Leon Cooperman, was cited by the New York Post as saying that he would stick with a pause on donations to the prestigious institution that started shortly after the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7.

Bruins star's wife reportedly files for divorce amid legal troubles,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Milan Lucic's wife, Brittany, filed for divorce on Monday night citing ""irreconcilable differences,"" according to TMZ Sports.
The Boston Bruins star was arrested in the early hours of Nov. 18 after an alleged domestic violence dispute. Brittany Lucic listed the date of their separation as the previous night.
Lucic took a leave of absence from the team following the alleged dispute and pleaded not guilty to assaulting her. He has not played since Oct. 21.

According to a Boston Police Department report, Lucic appeared intoxicated when officers arrived at his North End apartment early Saturday after his wife reported that he tried to choke her. Brittany Lucic told the responding officers that her husband had pulled her hair, but said he did not try to strangle her. She declined an offer of medical treatment.
The two got married on July 19, 2012, and the case was eventually dismissed in February after Brittany decided not to testify against her husband.
""The organization takes these matters very seriously, and we will work with the Lucic family to provide any support and assistance they may need,"" the team said in a statement at the time of his arrest.

""Obviously aware of what happened last night with Luc. The biggest thing for us is we're a family in here. We're all very, very close. We're obviously very concerned, upset for them and what they're going through, but we have a lot of support for (Lucic's wife) Brittany and the kids and Luc himself,"" team captain Brad Marchand said back in November.
Lucic is a veteran of over 1,300 NHL games with the Bruins, Los Angeles Kings, Edmonton Oilers and Calgary Flames. He won the Stanley Cup with Boston in 2011 and returned to the team for this season after signing a one-year free agent contract last summer worth $1 million with $500,000 in possible additional incentives.

Watchdog CEO confronts anti-Israel agitators: 'Which is your favorite terrorist group?',"Columbia University student David Pomerantz shares his firsthand experience on campus as anti-Israel protests raise concerns.
FIRST ON FOX: A watchdog organization with a focus on higher education released footage exposing the chaos occurring at the epicenter of the anti-Israel protests plaguing one of America's most prestigious Ivy League universities.
Adam Guillette, president of Accuracy in Media, went to the Columbia University campus in New York City to speak with the people behind the anti-Israel protests that have erupted at the school, filming his encounters in a video shared with Fox News Digital.
Guillette, who is Jewish, confronted several individuals at the protest but did not receive a warm welcome when he asked them questions about Hamas, the safety of Jewish students, and why they were protesting Israel.
One person said students are not being threatened on the campus, despite the Morningside main campus switching to hybrid or remote learning for the remainder of the spring semester due to safety concerns.

When asked who their favorite terrorist group was, one activist said, ""IDF,"" which stands for the Israel Defense Forces, the military of Israel.
Others cursed at Guillette or told him to ""shut up"" when asked if Hamas should remain in charge of ""Palestine."" Another person flipped off Guillette and told him to ""f--- off.""

""[Columbia University President] Minouche Shafik has failed time and again to protect Jewish students on campus and hold antisemitic students and faculty accountable,"" Guillette said in a statement to Fox News Digital last week.
""During Wednesday’s hearing, Shafik made a number of empty promises and insincere statements about the state of antisemitism on Columbia’s campus,"" he continued. ""Just one day later, radical antisemites continued to terrorize Jewish students on campus and spew their hateful ideology. The last 48 hours have made it abundantly clear that Shafik is not fit to serve as Columbia President.""
The cameraman filming for Accuracy in Media was reportedly assaulted while filming the agitators, according to the video.

""One thing that is abundantly clear is that this campus is out of control,"" Guillete said in the video. ""These are radicals, they need to be held accountable.""

The Cowboys roster already features a fair number of players on the roster who already carry sizable salary cap hits. The franchise is also weighing lucrative contract extensions for some of their key players. But, Jones, the longtime Cowboys owner and general manager, shouldered the blame for the lack of progress on the contracts.
""If you've got trouble with when the timing is around here,"" Jones said, ""it's because I'm not ready to go.""

Quarterback Dak Prescott, star wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and linebacker Micah Parsons are among the star players who are in line to land big pay days. Prescott has handled the starting quarterback duties for the past eight seasons.
The 30-year-old's contract expires after the 2024 season. He recently hinted that negotiations with the Cowboys have yet to kick off, but he added that he and Jones were ""aligned"" about where things stood.
COWBOYS' DAK PRESCOTT HAS NO 'FEAR' ABOUT FUTURE AS HE ENTERS FINAL YEAR OF CONTRACT
""Honestly, I'm focused on the moment, on the now,"" Prescott said. ""If the talks begin and real talks get to happen, sure, we can talk about getting that done, but in this case right now I'm worried about getting better, being better than I am at this moment. So leaving that up to my agent and Jerry at this point.""
Meanwhile, Lamb is set to play in the upcoming season under his fifth-year option. He could receive the franchise tag designation next year. Parsons, a three-time All-Pro, remains under his rookie contract, but he is eligible for the franchise tag after the 2025 season.

Jones expressed interest in seeing ""some more action"" as it relates to the contracts.
""You may be working on [contracts] and not moving anything but your eyebrows,"" Jones said. ""Who in the world would think that we're not working on it? I work on it. It pops up at 2 in the morning sometimes. What you're actually questioning is why don't you have something done and negotiated and put in the drawer? Well, we'd like to see some more leaves fall. We'd like to see some more action.""
Lamb and his agent could be waiting to see the terms of a contract Justin Jefferson potentially ends up getting from the Minnesota Vikings.

""You don't think the representatives of Jefferson and CeeDee and [Cincinnati's Ja'Marr Chase] aren't talking? You don't think they got their eye on something really big? Please,"" Stephen Jones, the Cowboys executive vice president, said.
""They're not ready to come in here. Same thing with Micah. Same thing with Dak. It's a little cat and mouse. And total respect for them.""
The Cowboys watched star offensive lineman Tyron Smith, running Tony Pollard and Tyler Biadasz sign with other teams this offseason.

Jerry cited the salary cap restraints that exist within the NFL when he discussed the inevitable departures of star players over the years.
""Dak has enjoyed, in his career that we're proud of, some of the best supporting casts that you could put around him,"" Jerry Jones said. ""To move forward, we will have to diminish that. That's a fact. That's the rules. That's our challenge and to make it work out: Dak as the quarterback of the Cowboys. I don't even have a blink on that one.""

Jayden Daniels' second pick odds shortening,"As the 2024 NFL Draft draws closer, the Jayden Daniels hype continues to grow.
This week, the former LSU Tigers star and 2023 Heisman Trophy winner's odds to go No. 2 overall to the Washington Commanders have moved drastically.
As of Monday, Daniels' odds to go second sat at -120. He's now the heavy favorite to go second in the draft at -400, replacing Drake Maye in that spot. Maye's odds to be selected No. 2 now sit at +330.
Here's a look at his latest odds via DraftKings Sportsbook and insights from FOX Sports experts.
JAYDEN DANIELS DRAFT PICK NUMBER ODDS: *
To be No. 1 overall pick: +2500 (bet $10 to win $260 total)To be No. 2 overall pick: -400 (bet $10 to win $12.50 total)To be No. 3 overall pick: +350 (bet $10 to win $45 total)
TEAM TO DRAFT JAYDEN DANIELS ODDS: *
Washington Commanders: -400 (bet $10 to win $12.50 total)New England Patriots: +350 (bet $10 to win $45 total)Las Vegas Raiders: +500 (bet $10 to win $60 total)Minnesota Vikings: +850 (bet $10 to win $95 total)New York Giants: +1700 (bet $10 to win $180 total)Chicago Bears: +2500 (bet $10 to win $260 total)Denver Broncos: +3500 (bet $10 to win $360 total)Tennessee Titans: +3500 (bet $10 to win $360 total)
* odds as of 4/23/24
According to Ben Fawkes, from last Friday evening to 10 a.m. ET Monday at Fanatics Sportsbook, there was more than 11 times more money on Daniels to go No. 2 than all other draft props.
Then there was this: While praising Daniels in an interview after his pro day at LSU last month, Tigers coach Brian Kelly said his former quarterback will get the ball out to the playmakers and make plays ""for Washington.""
Did Kelly accidentally tip the Commanders' hand, the team that owns the second pick?
Kelly kept things closer to the vest on an April 23 appearance on ""The Herd"" with Colin Cowherd, but still heaped praise on Daniels, saying that the concerns around Daniels' slender build and possible durability against NFL defenses were far outweighed by the positives he brings to the pros.
""If he was a poor decision-maker, if he was sloppy with the football, if he couldn't walk into an NFL locker room and lead the guys, then those are the things that lead you to not getting any sleep,"" Kelly said. ""He can put on weight. Those are small concerns. He is a flat-out playmaker. He will change the look of your franchise, and that's why I think he's the best quarterback in the draft.""
FOX Sports college football lead analyst Joel Klatt also moved Daniels to No. 2 overall in his final 2024 mock draft.
""I would personally draft Drake Maye — I think Maye has the higher upside — I just hear way too much in NFL circles about Jayden Daniels and how much these guys love Jayden Daniels,"" Klatt said. ""Part of that is that he's a bit of a safer pick. He may not have the overall ceiling that Maye does, but he is a safer pick. I know that [new Commanders offensive coordinator] Kliff Kingsbury loves Jayden Daniels, and I think that Washington goes with Jayden Daniels.""
However, FOX Sports betting analyst and ""The Herd"" co-host Jason McIntyre said in his latest mock draft that fans should take the Daniels hype with a big grain of salt.
""Don't fall for the 'Jayden Daniels is a better fit for Kliff Kingsbury's offense' takes,"" McIntyre wrote. ""Drake Maye's wheels are better than many know — he has six games of 70-plus rushing yards in the last two seasons — and he's going to make Washington dangerous quickly.""

Texas DT Byron Murphy a top-10 pick,"The 2024 NFL Draft is a few days away, and scouts are buzzing over the 2024 class. Evaluators have finished their scouting reports as teams finalized their draft boards earlier in the week. After exchanging a few texts with scouts and coaches around the league, here are some bold draft predictions to keep an eye on:
The top three quarterbacks come off the board within the first three picks
Since the beginning of the pre-draft process, nearly every mock draft has featured USC's Caleb Williams, LSU's Jayden Daniels, and North Carolina's Drake Maye coming off the board 1-2-3 in some order. While the jury is still out on whether the Commanders pick Daniels at No. 2, the ""Big Three"" are in a different class than their peers (Michigan's J.J. McCarthy, Washington's Michael Penix Jr., and Oregon's Bo Nix), and the draft will reflect the league's view on their talent disparity.
As evaluators select prospects based on performance projections at the next level, it is essential for blue-chip quarterbacks to possess a ""superpower"" that sets them apart from the pack. Williams (improvisational playmaking ability), Daniels (elite passing and running skills), and Maye (prototypical size, athleticism and arm talent) are traditional first-round talents who would earn top-10 grades in any draft class. Though I believe Penix Jr. (arm talent) should be included in the discussion, the Washington standout's injury history overshadows his potential as a QB1 in meeting rooms.
UCLA's Laiatu Latu will be the most dominant defender from the 2024 class
The UCLA standout might not come off the board as the first pass rusher selected in this year's draft, but Latu will be the unanimous selection for the best defender in the draft when we review the 2024 class in a few years.
As an explosive pass rusher with an expansive toolbox that features an array of maneuvers, Latu is a potential double-digit sack artist from the time he steps onto the field as a rookie. From his explosive first-step quickness to his dynamic closing burst and violent hand-to-hand combat skills, he is one of the rare pass rushers capable of winning with force or finesse off the edge.
With teams desperately looking for playmakers with ""splash play"" potential, the UCLA standout displays the traits that routinely lead to Pro Bowl honors and impressive individual accolades.
Byron Murphy II will be a surprise top-10 selection
After flying under the radar for most of the pre-draft process, the Texas product will be confirmed as an elite prospect as a top-10 pick. Murphy displays impressive tools and playmaking skills as a disruptive interior defender.
The 6-foot, 297-pounder flashes heavy hands and quick feet, running over and around blockers at the point of attack. Murphy routinely blows past blockers with an explosive first step while displaying outstanding snap count anticipation and burst. Though his speed and quickness force blockers to pause, Murphy's overwhelming power produces the negative plays coaches covet from blue-chip defensive tackles.
Given his potential impact as a destructive force between the tackles, Murphy should come off the board.
Offensive tackles will dominate the first round
The 2024 draft is loaded with talent, but the offensive tackle class ranks above the rest. This year's collection of dancing bears on the edge will allow teams to fortify their offensive line for the next decade. While the class features a mix of candidates with the capacity to play on the left or right side, the league's shift towards a pass-centric focus has made it imperative to have a dominant run blocker/pass protector on each edge.
As teams debate the pecking order with Notre Dame's Joe Alt, Oregon State's Taliese Fuaga, Washington's Troy Fautanu, Penn State's Olumuyiwa Fashanu, Georgia's Amarius Mims, Alabama's JC Latham, Oklahoma's Tyler Guyton and Arizona's Jordan Morgan vying for first-round consideration, the 2024 class could set a record for the number of blue-chip prospects selected in the first round.
The league's newfound respect for ""Nickel"" corners could change the draft landscape
The offensive shift towards ""11"" personnel (one back, one tight end, and three receivers) has made it imperative for evaluators to search for defensive backs with skills specifically suited for the slot. The hybrid position requires defensive backs to possess the quickness and movement skills to shadow cat-quick receivers while also displaying the toughness and aggressiveness to mix it up as run defenders.
With more teams also integrating defensive backs into the pass rush plan, the ""Nickel"" corner has become a place for the decathletes on the field. In the 2024 class, the collection of cornerbacks and safeties with slot defender skills will enable more teams to employ various five-DB packages with ""bigs"" (safeties) and ""littles"" (cornerbacks) on the field.
The need for variety could result in Iowa's Cooper DeJean, Alabama's Terrion Arnold, Michigan's Mike Sainristril, Georgia Tykee Smith, and Kamari Lassiter earning high marks as designated slot defenders for prospective teams. As more teams utilize ""Nickel"" packages as their base defense, the value of slot defenders could soar over draft weekend.

"Texans unveil redesign, new secondary logo","The Houston Texans have redesigned their look.
Houston became the fifth team this offseason to introduce a uniform change on Tuesday, unveiling a complete redesign of all four of their uniforms (home, away, alternate, color rush) for the first time since the franchise's inception in 2000. The look also includes a pair of new helmets.
The Texans' new home uniforms carry a similar resemblance to the ones they wore for the previous 22 seasons, making some tweaks to the Deep Steel Blue jerseys. The nameplates will have red coloring instead of white, a rarity for a home team's jersey. They also got rid of the red stripes on the side of the shoulders, replacing it with the team's bull logo. To add to the ""Texas-inspired"" look, the home uniforms include the Texans' new secondary ""H"" logo.
The away uniforms are Liberty White, also containing a similar look to the Texans' previous road jerseys. They have the traditional sleeve stripe on the back and sides of the jersey's shoulder pads that turn into a ""a bullhorn-inspired design"" on the front. Just like with the home uniforms, the away uniforms will be paired with their traditional bull logo and Deep Steel Blue helmet.
Houston transformed its alternate and color rush looks. The Texans described their new alternate uniforms as a ""bold Battle Red version of the away jersey,"" having the same bullhorn mark along the shoulders. The nameplates and numbers are also Deep Steel Blue with Liberty White trims. The helmet is Battle Red with ""candy paint red flakes and a red metallic chrome facemask"" while there's a new bullhorn look on the helmet with blue outlining.
Finally, the color rush uniforms are Deep Steel Blue but also introduce H-Town Blue, the first new color the team has introduced since its inception. The uniforms are paired with helmets that have the team's new secondary logo, an ""H"" with the H-Town Blue coloring and a lone star right next to it that's Battle Red. The H-Town Blue logo is a similar color to the blue that was seen on the Houston Oilers' uniforms before the franchise moved to Tennessee.
The change to the uniforms comes after the team conducted 10,000 surveys and 30 focus groups to ensure they're ""H-Town made.""
""Today, for the first time since 2000, we are so proud to reveal our new uniforms. They are even more special because they are inspired by and for our fans,"" Texans chairman and CEO Cal McNair said in a statement. ""Our fans asked us to be more H-Town and we delivered. They were with us every step of the way and there's truly something for everyone over the four uniforms.""
To promote the uniform redesigns, the Texans are holding numerous events in the Houston area and have agreements with establishments within the city to showcase the new looks.
The Texans' decision to revamp their look came after one of their best seasons in franchise history. First-year coach DeMeco Ryans led the team to a 10-7 record as C.J. Stroud had one of the best rookie seasons ever for a quarterback, winning the AFC South. They also made it to the Divisional Round of the playoffs.
Now, entering Year 2 of the partnership, the duo has a new look.
The Denver Broncos are honoring local culture and their franchise's past as part of their new uniform designs.
Denver unveiled its ""Mile High Collection"" of new uniforms on Monday, with the jerseys inspired by the Rocky Mountains and the franchise's history. The Sunset Orange jerseys will serve as the Broncos' home uniforms, while the Summit White jerseys will be their away uniforms. The Midnight Navy jerseys will be a part of their alternate uniforms.
In addition to unveiling the ""Mile High Collection,"" the Broncos also released their throwback uniforms, honoring the Orange Crush era from 1977. Just like its uniforms in 1977, Denver's throwback uniforms are orange with oversized white numbers and a Legacy Blue trim. The pants have an orange and Legacy Blue stripe running down the legs.
The Broncos are also bringing back the Legacy Blue ""D"" helmets with the Bronco mascot in the middle as part of the alternate look. The helmet was viewed as a fan favorite, wearing them for the majority of John Elway's time as their quarterback. They retired the helmets after the 1996 season, only wearing them for a special occasion once since then.
The ""Mile High Collection"" is the sixth primary uniform in the team's history, but their first since 1997.
""This has been a thoughtful, collaborative journey that's involved us listening to voices throughout all of Broncos Country to design the 'Mile High Collection,' our modern and inspirational new uniforms for the Denver Broncos,"" Broncos president Damani Leech said in a statement. ""We're grateful for the engagement and creativity of ownership, the players, our business and football leadership, Nike and especially the best fans in the NFL during this process.
""As we honor the championship tradition of the Broncos, we're also committed to innovation and growth during such a transformative time in franchise history. Our new uniforms — the 'Mile High Collection' — boldly integrate elements of our past, present and future while paying tribute to Colorado and the Rocky Mountain Region we proudly call home.""
In the ""Mile High Collection"" uniforms, the jerseys have multiple odes to Colorado. The block-style numbering and the nameplate's font are similar to Colorado's national parks signage. A triangle label that reflects a summit marker is included on the outer neck tag and jersey numbers while the inner neck tag has ""Broncos Country"" and ""5280"" (the number of feet Denver is above sea level) written on it.
More than 10,000 fans were surveyed about the ""Mile High Collection"" uniforms as part of the two-year-long process. Broncos players and team personnel also gave input on the changes.
Following their best season in three decades, the Detroit Lions unveiled new uniforms that combined their past with a modern touch on Thursday.
The team reworked their Honolulu Blue home uniforms and their away white uniforms while bringing back their black alternate uniforms. The Ford Bronco actually served as an inspiration for the Lions' redesign, looking to bring a ""fresh look"" to the uniforms they wore in the early 1990s. The striping along the uniforms was also inspired by the Ford Mustang, having a similar sleek design.
In addition to the Ford inspiration, the other changes to the home and away uniforms include a ""cowcatcher-shaped mesh collar design and a horizontal seam in the shape of a ""V.'"" The collar design pushes the font further down the chest. They also include a patch under the inside back collar that honors longtime Lions owner William Clay Ford. The inside collar of the home jerseys has ""ONE PRIDE"" inscribed on it while the away jerseys have ""DETROIT"" inscribed across the chest for the first time in team history.
""We are excited to launch a new era of Lions football,"" Lions team president Rod Wood said in a statement. ""Honolulu Blue and Silver has defined the Detroit Lions for generations and I am proud that we found a way to continue to evolve the look with a nod to the past and a focus on the future. The traditional look of our primary jerseys combined with the bold attitude of our alternate jerseys capture the essence of Detroit and the multi-generational fans base that supports us.""
The black alternate uniforms, which were introduced in 2003, are being brought back for the time since 2016, in part, because of Dan Campbell.
""We're in the draft room literally months into his tenure, and he wore the black when he was here,"" Wood told reporters Thursday. ""He said, 'Rod, when can we get the black jerseys back?'
""I said, 'I'll make a deal, when you win the division I'll bring the black jerseys back.' So I went out on a limb. Thankfully, he delivered. That's a true story.""
The black jerseys have blue numbers with silver outlining as the ""LIONS"" wordmark is placed along the chest. ""MOTOR CITY"" is inscribed in the back color. The jerseys can be paired with the team's all-black pants or blue pants while they wore blue helmets with uniforms at the unveiling ceremony.
The Cleveland Browns are going back in time to make a tweak to their look for the 2024 NFL season.
White facemasks are returning to the Browns' helmets, the team shared Wednesday. The team had brown facemasks on their helmet since 2015, rocking the look with the orange helmet.
But prior to 2006, the Browns wore white facemasks with orange helmets for decades. They had the white facemasks from 1975-95 before the team moved to Baltimore. When the Browns returned as an expansion franchise in 1999, the team brought back the orange helmet, white facemask look, keeping it through the end of the 2005 season.
The look is commonly associated with the Browns' best years in the modern era. They wore white facemasks with orange helmets in the 1980 ""Kardiac Kids"" season and in the three seasons that Bernie Kosar quarterbacked the team to the AFC Championship Game in the late 1980s. Those remain the only three AFC Championship Game appearances in the franchise's history.
""We are excited to honor our storied history through the return of the white facemask,"" Cleveland Browns Partner JW Johnson said in a statement. ""As we continue to write the next chapter of Browns' history, we reflect on different eras, such as the Kardiac Kids and the return of the franchise, that led us to this place in time.""
The team has brought back the white facemask look on a pair of occasions in recent years, wearing it once in each of the last two seasons. The Browns won both games.
With the facemask change, the Browns will also alter their logo. Their logo previously had a brown facemask with the helmet, but they'll also feature a white facemask now instead.
""We heard our loyal fans and are thrilled to see the white facemask featured on the Browns' helmets beginning with the 2024 season and beyond as we continue to write the history of our franchise,"" Johnson said.
The Browns have tinkered with their look on a handful of occasions in recent years. They had a major redesign in 2015 with the uniforms before moving back to their more traditional look in 2020. The biggest change they've made since 2020 was the addition of their all-white alternate uniforms, which include a mostly white helmet with white pants and jerseys.
The Browns are just one of a handful of teams who are redesigning their uniforms this offseason. Let's take a look at what other uniform redesigns are coming around the league.
The Jets were the first team to introduce new redesigned uniforms for the 2024 season, unveiling their ""legacy collection"" jerseys that pay homage to the team's Sack Exchange era.

Singer’s famous lyrics turn city street corner into travel destination for tourists,"TSA Administrator David Pekoske discusses air travel demand, flight disruptions, his experience going through TSA and firearm detections at checkpoints.
Jackson Browne was a rising singer-songwriter in 1972 when he penned one of the most memorable lines in American music history.
""Well I’m standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona / And such a fine sight to see,"" he wrote in the second verse of ""Take It Easy.""
Just about every American of a certain vintage can easily recite a young man's triumphant testimony that follows.
HOW TWO RIVAL TITANS OF ROCK ‘N’ ROLL TURNED A NYC TENEMENT INTO A GLOBAL MUSIC LANDMARK
""It’s a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford / Slowing down to take a look at me.""
Browne described the origin of the song in an interview with the British music site Uncut in 2013.
Winslow, Arizona was immortalized in ""Take It Easy,"" the debut single by the Eagles in 1972. Written by Jackson Browne, it memorably describes a girl ""in a flatbed Ford slowing down to take a look"" at a man ""standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona.""  (Standinonthecorner.org)
""I took a road trip in this old beat-up Willys Jeep and I went to Utah and Arizona. On that trip, I started to write ‘Take It Easy,'"" he said.
""When I came back, I played it for Glenn Frey, and he asked if the Eagles could cut it when it was done … It was their first single, and what those guys did with it was incredible.""
The atmospheric, all-American country-rock anthem, complete with quick-picking background banjo, made the Eagles major stars.
ISRAEL'S FAVORITE COMFORT FOOD, SHAKSHUKA, IS A HOT TASTE TREND RICH IN TRADITION, GLOBAL INFLUENCES
Winslow in the early 1970s was a little city of about 8,500 people made bustling by its location on legendary Route 66.
The Eagles by the end of the decade soared into the pantheon of greatest acts in music history. But the little city that gave their first hit wings was effectively wiped off the map.

Interstate 40 opened in 1979, feeding high-speed traffic north of the city.
""The freeway bypassed us and then basically downtown Winslow died,"" Stephanie Lugo, a board member for the Standing on the Corner Foundation, told Fox News Digital in an interview.
""The freeway bypassed us and then basically downtown Winslow died.""
The same fate befell hundreds of communities along the 2,500 miles of Route 66 that connected Chicago to Los Angeles.
Winslow had something few others had. It had pop-culture immortality, in the image of a young man catching the fancy of a young lady in a truck.
MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INVENTED THE ELECTRIC GUITAR AND INSPIRED ROCK ‘N’ ROLL
Standing on the Corner Park, featuring a life-size statue of a man with a guitar between his feet and, presumably, ""seven women on my mind,"" opened in 1999.

Winslow might have become just another desert ghost town.
Instead, it's a destination for rock fans and selfie seekers from around the world.
Winslow added a second statue in 2016 of Frey, soon after the singer died.
""It’s a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford / Slowing down to take a look at me.""
Lugo said 300 people or more stop for photographs on any single day.
""On holidays and weekends, the crowd is nonstop,"" she said, ""especially in the summer time when kids are out of school.""

The park, she added, ""definitely helped rebuild our downtown. We have several new restaurants and new shops. The downtown has come back to life.""
Browne certainly had no idea his song would ever be heard, let alone help recapture the glory of a small desert town.

Among other claims to fame, ""Take It Easy"" is the first track on the greatest-selling album of all time.
""Eagles: Their Greatest Hits (1971-75)"" has sold 38 million certified albums, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.
It surpassed Michael Jackson’s ""Thriller"" (34 million) for the No. 1 spot in 2018.

"Activists eye new target in preview of summer protests, vow to make people 'miserable'","Fox News White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich reports on President Biden promoting his green agenda in Virginia on 'Special Report.'
A group of climate activists are eyeing their next big protest over the summer.
In a statement to group members and supporters, Climate Defiance is calling for a ""historic blockade"" of the Congressional Baseball Game, an annual competition where Republican and Democratic members of Congress compete in America’s favorite pastime.
""We - society, humanity - are careening into an abyss. The decisions we make now will reverberate not for centuries, but for millennia. If we do not act now, boldly and swiftly, millions will die from storms and from starvation,"" Climate Defiance said in an email to supporters.
""So long as Congress torches our planet, we won’t give them a moment of rest. It is unconscionable that they play games while destroying our prospect for a decent future,"" Climate Defiance founder Michael Greenberg said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Our entire world faces imminent catastrophe. Congress has the power to save millions – even billions – of lives. The fact that they haven’t already ended fossil fuel subsidies is shameful. We’re shutting down the Congressional Baseball Game to send a message: we will do whatever it takes to force those in power to end fossil fuels.""

In the mass email, Greenberg said he organized a similar protest at the Congressional Baseball Game two years ago as ""it is unconscionable that they play games as our prospects for a decent future slip out of our grip.""
The protest did not materialize, however, after the U.S. Senate reached a deal on climate spending just ahead of the scheduled event, meeting the group’s interests.
So, Climate Defiance is organizing another attempt to disrupt the game.

""This March was the warmest on record – the tenth month in a row that was the hottest ever. Our planet is burning, and Congress is playing baseball,"" the environmental group said in the email.

The anticipated protest is targeting members of both parties as ""like the Congressional Baseball Game, fossil fuel subsidies are a bipartisan affair,"" Climate Defiance told Fox News Digital. It added, ""Biden’s 2023 budget plan even proposed cutting tens of billions in tax breaks for fossil fuel companies, but House Democrats themselves fought to keep those subsidies in place.""
""We are not asking you to give money right now. We are not asking you to sign a petition, or call your legislator, or tweet. We are asking you to join us, in person, in a blockade of the Congressional Baseball Game,"" the group instructed members. ""Shut it down with us.""
On the Climate Defiance website, the group calls for ""consistent, mass-turnout, nonviolent disruption to stop business as usual and compel politicians to act.""
""When we engage in direct action — whether through a strike, a blockade, or a mass occupation — we break through,"" it continues. ""Direct action puts the state in a double-bind: allow the action (and the disruption) to continue or crack down, further driving up public support for the cause.""

In the email, the group clarifies, ""We’ve never blocked roads (no shade to those who do). We’ve never targeted artwork. What we do, and what we do very well, is take the fight directly to the people in power. We make their lives MISERABLE until they relent.""
""That is exactly what we will do at the Congressional Baseball Game.""

Google firing office agitators shows tide is turning,"Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen joins Americas Newsroom to discuss Google employees protests over the companys contract with the Israeli government.
Activist employees may be losing their grip on major businesses as some companies are starting to clamp down on workplace disruptions.
Following multiple anti-Israel protests at company headquarters earlier this month, Google fired 28 employees and issued a new announcement that emphasized a ""Mission First"" mindset.
""But ultimately we are a workplace and our policies and expectations are clear: this is a business, and not a place to act in a way that disrupts coworkers or makes them feel unsafe, to attempt to use the company as a personal platform, or to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics. This is too important a moment as a company for us to be distracted,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote on Thursday.
Google’s apparent shift against politics follows other businesses' efforts to tamp down on employee activism in the workplace.

'GOOGLERS AGAINST GENOCIDE' ARRESTED AFTER 10 HOUR SIT-IN AT CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS: WATCH
""Business leaders are sending a warning to staff: Dissent that disrupts the workplace won’t be tolerated,"" according to a report from the Wall Street Journal Sunday. ""Bosses are losing patience with staff eager to be the conscience of their companies, especially as employees pressure them on charged issues such as politics and the war in Gaza, executives, board members and C-suite advisers say.""
After years of woke capitalism and encouraging employees to bring their whole selves to the office, ""The moves are a correction to the last several years, when corporate leaders often brooked dissent and encouraged staff to voice their personal convictions,"" the WSJ reported.
Hasan Ibraheem, a Google software engineer who was arrested and fired for taking part in the protest, remarked about how Google has changed from ""the big company that was still fun and vibrant"" where ""you were allowed to express yourself.""
""I wasn’t expecting that my labor would be going toward aiding a genocide, and that if I spoke up against that I would be instantly fired,"" Ibraheem told the WSJ.

""The perils of being ensnared in partisan politics is changing the calculus of how responsive companies should be to any issue that doesn’t directly affect business, some executives and corporate advisers say,"" the WSJ reported, pointing to Disney's battle with DeSantis and the backlash against. Anheuser-Busch InBev’s Bud Light.
Jonathan Bernstein, founder and chairman of Bernstein Crisis Management, explained to WSJ that while companies are struggling with workplace politics, leaders are ""are very concerned about public backlash, especially boards of directors.""
'GOOGLERS AGAINST GENOCIDE' CALLED OUT FOR OFFICE PROTESTS: THIS ISN'T FREE SPEECH, IT'S 'ENTITLEMENT'
The New York Times launched an investigation into itself over whether staff members were leaking information regarding the war in Gaza to other media outlets. This followed several insider reports that claimed employees were fighting over how the war was being covered.
In 2023, Starbucks also announced a lawsuit against the union Starbucks Workers United for using its name and logo in a series of pro-Palestinian posts shortly following the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel.
Outside these companies, some people are congratulating Google’s efforts to tamper down on political infighting within its ranks.
""I'm glad to see Google taking a step in this direction,"" Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who published a similar work memo in 2020, said.

He added, ""Although I suspect a much bigger step is needed, including exiting a material percentage of staff who aren't aligned with this direction. Google is a gem of American innovation, and it's been sad to see it captured by activists, who have disrupted work and squandered their early lead in AI. A culture of merit and innovation is what made Google great, and I hope they can get back to it.""

7-year-old boy who confessed to killing sleeping stranger won't face charges,"The Manhattan Institute fellow Hannah E. Meyers sits down with Fox News' Carley Shimkus to discuss an alarming uptick in child gun violence.
A 10-year-old Texas boy admitted to shooting a man he did not know more than two years ago while the victim slept, authorities said Friday – and he will not face charges.
The boy was days away from his 8th birthday on Jan. 18, 2022 when Brandon O'Quinn Rasberry, 32, was shot in the head one time while he slept at an RV park in Nixon, about 60 miles east of San Antonio. Rasberry had just moved in four days prior, the Gonzales County Sheriff's Office said.
A Nixon Smiley Independent School District principal told deputies on April 12 that the student had threatened to assault and kill another student on a bus the night prior. The school administrator contacted the sheriff's office after a threat assessment was conducted on the student, when the child confessed to shooting and killing a man two years ago.
""I was shocked, very shocked,"" Rasberry's father, Kenneth Rasberry, told KSAT 12 News. ""This isn’t anywhere the suspect that we thought it was.""

The boy was taken to a child advocacy center, where he described for interviewers details of Rasberry's death ""consistent with first-hand knowledge"" of the crime, investigators said.
The boy said he had been at the RV park visiting his grandfather, who lived a few lots away from Rasberry. The 10-year-old said he obtained a 9 millimeter ""dirt and army green""-colored pistol from the glove box of his grandfather's truck.
The boy described entering Rasberry's RV, shooting him in the head and shooting again into the couch before leaving, then returning the gun to the truck, investigators said.

The child said he had observed Rasberry walking around the RV earlier in the day, but he had never met him and had no reason to be mad at him. Rasberry's body was found after he failed to show up for work for two days.
The murder weapon was located Friday at a pawn shop in Seguin, after the child informed investigators that it had been pawned by his grandfather. It was secured as evidence and linked to the crime after two spent shell casings collected from the scene were sent for forensic analysis and comparison.
The boy was placed in 72-hour emergency detention ""because of the severity of the crime and because of the continued concern for the child’s mental wellbeing,"" the sheriff’s office said.

He was brought to a psychiatric hospital in San Antonio for evaluation and treatment and then was taken back to Gonzales County. He was placed in juvenile detention on a charge of making a terroristic threat for the school bus incident.
The child will not be charged with murder due to his age at the time of the crime, Gonzales County Sheriff's Office said. Criminal culpability begins at age 10, according to Texas law.

""He needs to be prayed on. He needs to be comforted ... He’s forgiven. And he can still be saved. He’s so young. He’s definitely tormented by something,"" Kenneth Rasberry told KSAT.

Jerry Seinfeld 'surprised by how hostile the reaction was' to his support for Israel,"""Seinfeld"" creator and comedian Jerry Seinfeld was greeted with protesters as he was leaving an event in New York City with Free Press founder Bari Weiss.
Comedian Jerry Seinfeld responded to backlash over his visit to Israel after the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks in a recent interview with GQ magazine.
Seinfeld arrived in Israel with his family in December and reportedly had an ""emotional"" meeting with the freed hostages and representatives of families whose loved ones are still held captive in Gaza, according to Israeli news outlet Haaretz.
The meeting at the Hostages and Missing Persons Forum's headquarters in Tel Aviv lasted two hours longer than expected, according to Channel 13 TV News in Israel. Seinfeld, in a video the outlet posted to X, appeared to don a dog tag that symbolized the hostages' struggles with the words ""Bring Them Home.""

""Well, I’m Jewish,"" the comedian said of his reason for visiting Israel. ""And you grow up learning about antisemitism, but it’s kind of in a book. It never crossed my mind that people would look at me as anything other than, ‘I like this comedian. I don’t like this comedian.’ I think most Jews of my generation never thought about antisemitism. It was from history books. And then it was something different. It was something different.""
Seinfeld said the ensuing criticism from anti-Israel voices in the media and among the American public surprised him.
""Every Jewish person I know was surprised by how hostile the reaction was,"" he said.

Still, Seinfeld said he didn't regret his trip to Israel.
""No, not at all,"" he said. ""I don’t preach about it. I have my personal feelings about it that I discuss privately. It’s not part of what I can do comedically, but my feelings are very strong.""
The legendary comedian has lent his support to the nation multiple times since Hamas terrorists launched surprise attacks on residential areas in Israel on Oct. 7.
Seinfeld posted an ""I Stand With Israel"" image on his Instagram account two days after Hamas' attacks.
""I lived and worked on a Kibbutz in Israel when I was 16 and I have loved our Jewish homeland ever since,"" he wrote in a caption. ""My heart is breaking from these attacks and atrocities. But we are also a very strong people in our hearts and minds.""
However, he has also faced attacks for his support for Israel. In February, the comedian was met by angry, profane protesters as he was leaving an event in New York City with Free Press founder Bari Weiss.
""Genocide supporter, you support genocide!"" protesters yelled at Seinfeld as he left an event on the Upper East Side on Saturday night, footage shared by FNTV showed.

Muslim prayer leader confronts anti-Israel agitator chanting 'Death to America',"Islamic House of Wisdom Imam Mohammad Ali Elahi told Fox News Digital that the ""Death to America"" chants at a recent Dearborn rally don't represent the community’s values.
DEARBORN HEIGHTS, Mich. — A Dearborn-area imam says he personally confronted a local protester who chanted slogans such as ""Death to America"" and ""Death to Israel"" at a recent rally.
""I am absolutely against saying ‘Death to America,'"" Imam Mohammad Ali Elahi told Fox News Digital. ""I know in certain countries they may say these things, but I am personally against it even when they say this in any country; doesn’t matter where you say it … because it doesn’t help.""
Elahi, who serves as imam at the local Islamic House of Wisdom mosque, spoke out shortly after a controversial rally held the last Friday of Ramadan in nearby Dearborn saw a speaker leading a crowd in chants of ""Death to America"" and ""Death to Israel."" Video of the incident sparked national headlines about extremism within the Michigan imam’s local community.
""Imam Khomeini, who declared the International Al-Quds Day, this is why he would say to pour all of your chants and all of your shouts upon the head of America,"" Tarek Bazzi, a Michigan-based activist associated with the Hadi institute, said in a video from the rally that was shared by the Middle East Media Research Institute.

'DEATH TO AMERICA,' 'DEATH TO ISRAEL' CHANTS POUR OUT OF MUSLIM PROTESTERS IN MICHIGAN ON LAST DAY OF RAMADAN
Elahi told Fox News Digital that while he did not attend the rally, he had ""heard about it,"" noting that he even confronted one of those who was seen chanting the slogan ""loudly"" at the event.
""I talked with him and I [expressed] my disappointment because we are not for death, we are for life. We are for love. We are for peace and justice,"" Elahi said.

Elahi noted that the rally was only a ""few people"" who chanted the slogan, arguing that those protesters represent a minority of the Dearborn community.
Nevertheless, the Michigan imam said he made sure to speak out against chanting such slogans publicly, including in his Friday prayer service the following week.
DEARBORN ‘UNCOMMITTEDS’ PLAN TO MAKE ‘EXAMPLE’ OF BIDEN, TURN PARTY AGAINST JEWISH STATE
The controversy surrounding the rally comes amid a backdrop of deep resentment toward current U.S. foreign policy among many members of the Arab population in the Dearborn community, who have fiercely argued against the Biden administration’s handling of the conflict in Gaza.
Dearborn, which has the highest per capita Muslim population in the country, became the center of resistance against President Biden's re-election bid as a result of his handling of the conflict, with organizers leading a movement that saw more than 100,000 people mark ""uncommitted"" on their ballots instead of supporting the president during Michigan’s Democrat primary.
Elahi acknowledged his own frustration with current U.S. policy in Gaza but said he encourages members of his community to peacefully take part in the democratic process instead of using violent rhetoric.
""As a Muslim community, we believe in voting, we believe in outreach,"" Elahi said.

DEARBORN ACTIVISTS' PUSH TO BAIL ON BIDEN SPREADS TO OTHER KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES
The Michigan imam said the Muslim community has many partners in the U.S. who have supported their political efforts, arguing that chants such as those at the Dearborn rally risk alienating those who have ""shown sympathy and solidarity with the Muslim community.""
""That is very harmful to the cause of our community,"" Elahi said. ""Because when you say this, America means us, people of America, that means that if we have 8 million Muslims, we are America, too. So, this is like kind of self-suicide, and we disagree with that.""
Elahi said he encourages those in his community to be ""part of the solution rather than part of the problem.""

"Trump vows to go after 'radical left' at colleges, focus on 'defending tradition' if elected","Columbia University student David Pomerantz shares his firsthand experience on campus as anti-Israel protests raise concerns.
Former President Trump said he plans to ""fire"" the ""radical left"" individuals that ""have allowed our colleges to become dominated by Marxist maniacs and lunatics"" and ensure higher education is focused on ""defending the American tradition"" if elected to a second term. The 2024 Republican presumptive presidential nominee posted an education policy video to his Truth Social Tuesday night amid violent antisemitic anti-Israel protests on college campuses across the nation.
TRUMP SLAMS COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY FOR CLOSING CAMPUS AMID ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS: 'MEANS THE OTHER SIDE WINS'
""For many years, tuition costs at colleges and universities have been exploding and I mean absolutely exploding,"" Trump said. ""While academics have been obsessed with indoctrinating America's youth, the time has come to reclaim our once great educational institutions from the radical left. And we will do that.""

Trump said his ""secret weapon"" will be the ""college accreditation system,"" which he says is called ""accreditation for a reason.""
""The accreditors are supposed to ensure that schools are not ripping off students and taxpayers, but they have failed totally,"" Trump said.
Accreditation is a third-party review process to review whether education programs meet defined standards of quality.
""When I return to the White House, I will fire the radical left, accreditors that have allowed our colleges to become dominated by Marxist maniacs and lunatics,"" the former president continued. ""We will then accept applications for new accreditors who will impose real standards on colleges once again, and once and for all.""
Trump said the standards would include ""defending the American tradition and Western civilization, protecting free speech, eliminating wasteful administrative positions that drive up costs, incredibly, removing all Marxist diversity, equity and inclusion bureaucrats, offering options for accelerated and low cost degrees, providing meaningful job placement and career services, and implementing college entrance and exit exams to prove that students are actually learning and getting their money's worth.""
Trump also said, if elected, he would direct the Justice Department to ""pursue federal civil rights cases against schools that continue to engage in racial discrimination.""

Trump added that schools ""that persist in explicit, unlawful discrimination under the guise of equity will not only have their endowments taxed, but through budget reconciliation.""
Trump said he would advance a measure to have universities ""fined up to the entire amount of their endowment.""
""A portion of the seized funds will then be used for restitution for victims of these illegal and unjust policies--policies that hurt our country so badly,"" he said.
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY MOVES TO HYBRID LEARNING ON MAIN CAMPUS AMID ANTISEMITIC PROTESTS
""Colleges have gotten hundreds of billions of dollars from hardworking taxpayers, and now we are going to get this anti-American insanity out of our institutions once and for all,"" he continued. ""We are going to have real education in America.""
The former president’s policy video was posted to Truth Social Tuesday afternoon, shortly before he blasted Columbia University for moving its classes virtual amid days and days of massive pro-Gaza protests on campus.
""They’re closing Columbia now? I mean, it’s just crazy,"" Trump said. ""Columbia should gain a little strength, a little courage and keep their school open.""

Trump’s comments came after students at Columbia University were instructed that classes had shifted to virtual or hybrid amid ongoing safety concerns stemming from the anti-Israel protests filling the campus.
""It’s crazy because that means the other side wins,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""When you start closing down colleges and universities—that means the other side [wins.]""

David Beckham's $10M lawsuit against Mark Wahlberg's fitness company to go to trial,"Check out what's clicking on FoxBusiness.com
David Beckham and Mark Wahlberg's companies will battle it out in court over money the English soccer star claims F45 owes him.
A judge ordered a jury trial, scheduled for January 2025, to settle the breach of contract matter, according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital. DB Ventures initially sued F45, a company Wahlberg partially owns, in 2022. However, the lawsuit was moved into federal court in May 2023.
Beckham claimed he entered into a five-year contract with F45 as a brand ambassador and would be compensated with $1.5 million a year along with shares of the fitness company to be given six months and 12 months after the company went public in 2021.
""Despite DBVL upholding its end of the bargain, however, F45 failed to issue substantial cash and equity compensation to DBVL as required by the parties’ agreement,"" the complaint filed by DB Ventures Limited read.

DB Ventures Limited claimed F45 failed to hand over the shares for eight months past the original date given. By that time, Beckham's company estimated the shares had dropped in price by $9.3 million, the court documents stated.
Beckham also asked the court to award $5 million, $4.5 million and $1.7 million for the additional claims listed in the lawsuit – all having to do with breach of contract.

Comedian shreds anti-Israel agitators at Columbia: 'You're supposed to be smart',"Actor and comedian Jon Lovitz spoke with Fox News Digital about antisemitism in Hollywood he says comes from other Jews.
Jewish actor and comedian Jon Lovitz called out the anti-Israeli agitators who continue to participate in raucous protests at Columbia University and other college campuses throughout the country.
In a post on X, Lovitz questioned the intelligence of the students at these rallies, which exploded on the university campus about a week ago. He also accused the student demonstrators of being pawns of their left-wing professors.
The former Saturday Night Live cast member posted on Monday, ""To the students at @Columbia, and any other students at colleges across the United States, blocking Jewish kids from entering the school to go to class: You're supposed to be smart. You're blaming your 18 year old classmates from the US for the actions of the government of Israel?""

""What the hell are you being taught?"" the comedian asked, adding, ""Think logically and quit being sheep & being used by your professors.""
Lovitz’s appeal to the protesters went viral on the social media platform, receiving over one million views, and thousands of comments of support.
Jewish actor and comedian Michael Rapaport showed support for Lovitz’s post, re-sharing it and commenting, ""LOUDER.""
Conservative author Carmine Sabia, wrote, ""This is decades of liberal indoctrination on college campuses. We are watching 1930s Germany happen here in the United States. But no for certain this was created by the progressive agenda. It starts with anti-Americanism.""
ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS HURL BOTTLES AT NYPD, FORM HUMAN CHAIN DURING MASS ARRESTS

The protests at Columbia began when agitators initially formed an encampment — setting up tents and refusing to leave — on the campus last Wednesday. The protesters have marched in and around the campus demanding the school lose affiliations with groups that support Israel amid its war with Hamas in Gaza.
Throughout the course of ongoing demonstrations, NYPD have arrested over 100 protesters. Concurrent protests at NYU led to the arrest of 133 demonstrators who clashed with police on Monday night, some of them having thrown bottles at NYPD officers.
Following Hamas’ Oct. 7 massacre in Israel, Lovitz weighed in on the antisemitism he has experienced in his own life in Hollywood.
In an interview with Fox News Digital in November, the comedian mentioned that the antisemitism he saw in the industry came from other Jewish people.
""And I've just had others where people say to me antisemitic stuff, and they're Jewish and in show business, and it's disgusting,"" he said. Elsewhere, he noted he has never experienced antisemitism from any of his non-Jewish friends in Hollywood,"" calling the notion, ""very weird.""

Tornado strikes Missouri event venue during wedding rehearsal,"They say rain on your wedding day is good luck, but what about a tornado? Brookdale Farms General Manager James Vavak joined FOX Weather on Tuesday to talk about an EF-1 tornado that tore through the venue during a wedding rehearsal in Eureka, Missouri.
EUREKA, Mo. – A Missouri tornado almost delayed a couple's wedding when the EF-1 twister ripped the roof off their event venue, but in less than 48 hours, the Brookdale Farms team scrambled to make it happen as planned.
The tornado hit on Thursday evening while the rehearsal was ongoing, with about 20 people in the building at Brookdale Farms in Eureka, Missouri, just outside St. Louis.
""My wedding coordinators really jumped into action when they saw the glass garage doors starting to bow in, and they got everyone to safety in time before a portion of the roof was ripped off,"" Brookdale Farms General Manager James Vavak said.
SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE REPORTED IN NORTHERN OHIO AFTER SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ROAR THROUGH GREAT LAKES
Another building on the property also suffered significant damage during the twister.
A portion of the event venue roof came off during the tornado, and one of the back doors was ripped out, but thankfully, no one was injured. However, the building was deemed unsafe, and the wedding was planned for Saturday evening, less than 48 hours away.

According to the National Weather Service in St. Louis, the April 16 EF-1 tornado caused the worst damage along Twin Rivers Road, where the venue is located.
Vavak said when he returned to the farm after the tornado, he immediately comforted the couple.
""She was keeping it together a lot better than I think a lot of brides would, but I knew on the inside she was panicked,"" Vavak said. ""She'd been working on planning the special day for about two years, and all of a sudden, all of your planning has been thrown out the window, literally.""

Vavak told the bride he and his team would do everything they could to ensure the wedding happened how she wanted.
It came down to the wire, but they made it happen.
Construction crews arrived at 7 a.m. Friday, and the final piece of the roof went up by 2:30 p.m. A county inspector arrived Saturday morning and gave Brookdale Farms a temporary permit, allowing the wedding to happen Saturday at 5 p.m.

Meet the American who stood firmly in the face of battle as a new nation fought for its life,"Born into a religious Massachusetts family that prized service over self, Abigail (Smith) Adams proved an illuminating spirit in America’s darkest days.
""These are the times that try men’s souls,"" Thomas Paine wrote near the end of the turbulent, fear-filled year of 1776.
It was the soul of a woman, however, that defiantly withstood the weight of the trial — the miraculous fight for American independence — with five children at her hip.
Abigail Adams never flinched, never wavered.
Neither the crown then nor fellow citizens today can mistake her gamble on a bold new nation called the United States.
MEET THE AMERICAN WHO MADE PRESCRIPTIONS SAFER, DEBORAH ADLER, INSPIRED BY HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR GRANDMA
""We are no ways dispirited here. We possess a spirit that will not be conquered,"" Adams wrote to her husband, John, on Sept. 20, 1776, days after George Washington’s colonial army was routed by the British in Brooklyn and Manhattan.
Adams was just 31 with five small children at her humble farmhouse, with her husband far from home for much of their marriage.

Running a wartime home without a husband by her side appeared to only fuel her defiant independence. She added in that same letter: ""If all our men are drawn off and we should be attacked, you would find a race of Amazons in America.""
The now-former first lady is remembered as a gifted writer, wife and confidante of a Founding Father and the first of just two women to be both wife and mother of U.S. presidents. She was joined in that distinction, nearly 200 years later, by Barbara Bush.
""She was a revolutionary in every sense of the word.""
But as her combative words proved, the 5-foot-6-inch New England mother was harder than the granite in the hills of Massachusetts. She stands among the greatest patriots in American history.
The toughest times in American history tried Adams' soul. The toughest times lost.

""No woman in the history of our nation contributed more or sacrificed more for our country than Abigail Adams,"" said Tom Koch, mayor of Quincy, Massachusetts, where Abigail lived most of her life, and a devoted scholar of Adams history.
She rests today within the Church of the Presidents, across from his office at Quincy City Hall.
He added, ""She was a revolutionary in every sense of the word.""
Abigail Smith was born on Nov. 22, 1744 in Weymouth, Massachusetts.
Her father, William Smith, was a Congregational minister. Her mother, Elizabeth (Quincy) Smith, was born into a prominent political family in colonial Massachusetts.

Abigail Adams' first cousin, Dorothy Quincy, was born and raised in the community of Quincy that would later bear the family name.
The first lady-to-be married a man born in Quincy, John Adams, in 1764.
Cousin Dorothy Quincy, for her part, married another rebel born in Quincy just a few hundred yards away from her. She and John Hancock wed in Oct. 1775, only six months after the Battle of Lexingon and Concord.

Adams and Hancock had betrothed themselves to a family steeped in warrior spirit and tradition.
""The origins of the Quincy family lie in Cuincy in northwestern Normandy, France, where a knight named ‘de Cuincy’ joined the 1066 invasion of Britain,"" historian Harlow Giles Unger wrote in ""John Quincy Adams,"" a biography of Abigail’s oldest son, the sixth U.S. president.
The name evolved to Quincy, he writes, noting that a nobleman, the Saer de Quincy, led a rebellion against John, King of England, and ""appears at the signing of the Magna Carta at Runnymede.""

The two women, Abigail and Dorothy, in other words, provided the genetic link between the Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence.
Both women bore eyewitnesses to the bloody birth of American independence.
Quincy watched the Battle of Lexington – April 19, 1775 – as 700 British troops marched on the tiny town in a quest to capture rebel munitions and her rebel beau, Hancock.
""The day, perhaps the decisive day, is come on which the fate of America depends. My bursting heart must find vent at my pen.""
Adams watched the rebellion intensify two months later. She climbed a hill near the humble family farmhouse, which doubled as her husband's law office, and watched the Battle of Bunker Hill erupt across Boston Harbor with her 7-year-old son, John Quincy.
""The day, perhaps the decisive day, is come on which the fate of America depends,"" she wrote afterward. ""My bursting heart must find vent at my pen.""
She knew a difficult life lay ahead, yet never wavered.

""While her husband was away serving the new nation, she was raising five children and running their farm in time of war,"" Massachusetts historian Alexander Cain told Fox News Digital.
""The Siege of Boston was essentially outside her front door. She had to deal with inflation and food shortages and a daughter [Nabby], who was gravely ill.""
She remained devoted to American independence in its darkest hours despite enormous risk.

""She would have lost everything. Her husband would have been tried for treason, her property confiscated,"" said Cain.
""But she was devoted to the cause and knew she had to set an example for her fellow women and fellow patriots. She was tough. She was absolutely tough.""
The voluminous correspondence of 1,100 letters between Abigail and John Adams provide perhaps the most important primary source of study of the American Revolution.

""Abigail (Smith) Adams did not have a formal education, but proved to be an extremely resourceful partner to John Adams,"" reports the website of the Massachusetts Historical Society, the repository today of the correspondence between the two.
""While he was away on numerous political assignments, she raised their children, managed their farm, and stayed abreast of current events during one of the country's most turbulent times.""
""Abigail Adams proved to be an extremely resourceful partner to John Adams.""
The letters, the site observes, ""demonstrate her perceptive comments about the Revolution and contain vivid depictions of the Boston area.""
Adams proved her steel during the Second Continental Congress, where the delegation born in Quincy – her husband, Hancock and Samuel Adams – went to Philadelphia to convince the other colonies to join the revolt.
The rebellion was over in Massachusetts, the colony that effectively revolted against the British alone at first.

The Redcoats fled Boston in humiliation on March 17, 1776. They never returned.
The war moved elsewhere, to New York and the southern colonies.
But the stakes only grew higher. So did the fear.
But one rebellion wasn’t enough for Abigail.
MEET THE AMERICAN WHO WROTE ‘THE BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC’
The Founding Fathers understood that they sat on the cusp of an unprecedented opportunity in history, to remake a more equitable society for mankind.
Adams saw the same unprecedented opportunity to remake a more equitable society for womankind.
""I desire you would remember the Ladies,"" Adams wrote to her husband in the days before the passage of the Declaration of Independence.

The two sentences that follow ""remember the ladies"" portray the fire of her revolutionary spirit and signature defiance.
""Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could,"" she wrote. ""If particular care and attention is not paid to the Ladies, we are determined to foment a Rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation.""
""The Ladies … are determined to foment a Rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice.""
The demand represented a conviction to independence displayed by American women not often chronicled in history books, according to Cain.
""Women played a significant role in the build-up of the war,"" he said. ""They were the ones boycotting British goods and hosting spinning bees to make their own fabric so they didn't have to buy British fabric. They were the ones who had to protect the home front and care for the children.""

Adams' cry to ""remember the ladies"" was a demand, Cain said, to recognize the role women played in American independence.
Abigail Adams died on Oct. 28, 1818. She was 73 years old.
John Adams lived six more years.
He died hauntingly on July 4, 1826 – the same exact day as Thomas Jefferson – the 50th anniversary of the American Independence both men famously helped forge.

The couple's oldest son, John Quincy, was serving as secretary of state under President James Monroe at the time of Abigail Adams' death.
She never got to see her son, the scared little boy who watched the Battle of Bunker Hill at his mother's side, ascend to the White House — which he did in 1825.
She did not get to see her son ascend to the White House.
John and Abigail Adams, plus John Quincy Adams and his wife, Louisa Catherine Adams, lie side by side today in granite tombs in the family crypt in the United First Parish Church in Quincy.
It's better known locally as the Church of the Presidents. The congregation dates back to 1639. The Rev. John Hancock, father of the patriot, was once its minister. He's buried across the street in a nearly 400-year-old cemetery alongside 69 veterans of the American Revolution.

John and Abigail Adams moved into an estate in Quincy after the war, which they dubbed Peacefield, the name reflecting their hopes after decades of turmoil.
It's now the centerpiece of the Adams National Historical Park, along with the nearby birthplaces of the two presidents.

"On this day in history, April 23, 1564, William Shakespeare is born in Stratford-upon-Avon","Denzel Washington on his start on stage, creative joy seeking new projects, and co-starring in new ""Macbeth"" adaptation
Legendary playwright, poet and actor William Shakespeare is believed to have been born on this day in history, April 23, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon, England.
Shakespeare's exact date of birth was not recorded, says the website for the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust — but his baptism at Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon was documented as taking place on April 26, 1564.
""No records of births and deaths were made in those days. We do, however have records of his baptism on (April 26th 1564: Gulielimus, filius Johannes Shakspeare) and of his burial on (25th April 1616: Will Shakspeare, Gent),"" says the website for Holy Trinity Church.
ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, APRIL 22, 1970, FIRST EARTH DAY IS CELEBRATED: ‘RARE POLITICAL ALIGNMENT’
As both his baptism and funeral occurred at Holy Trinity Church, ""it can be fairly safely assumed that he worshiped here as a boy and young man, and again after he retired to his home town,"" says the church's website.
The date of his baptism is another clue as to Shakespeare's birthdate, says the website for the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.

""Baptisms typically took place within three days of a new arrival, and parents were instructed by the Prayer Book to ensure that their children were baptized no later than the first Sunday after birth,"" it said.
As April 26, 1564, was a Wednesday, this means the earliest date of Shakespeare's birth could have been April 23, noted the website.
ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, DECEMBER 19, 1843, CHARLES DICKENS PUBLISHES 'A CHRISTMAS CAROL'
""Given that three days would be a reasonable interval between birth and baptism, 23 April has therefore come to be celebrated as his birthday,"" said the site.
Shakespeare's parents were John and Mary Shakespeare, notes the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust website; he was the third of eight children.
He was the oldest surviving male child, said the site.
Shakespeare authored at least 37 plays during his lifetime.  (iStock)
From age seven until his mid-teens, Shakespeare attended grammar school in Stratford-upon-Avon. He married his wife, Anne Hathaway, in November 1582, says the same source.
At the time of their wedding, Shakespeare was 18 — and eight years younger than his 26-year-old bride, says the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.

Hathaway and Shakespeare would go on to have three children: Susanna, born in May 1583, and twins Hamnet and Judith in February 1585.

In the 23-year period between 1590 and 1613, Shakespeare wrote at least 38 plays.
He is believed to have collaborated on others, says the website for the British Library.
The ""First Folio"" contained 36 of Shakespeare's plays.
He also published a book of more than 100 sonnets in 1609, said the British Library.
By 1592, Shakespeare had established himself as a playwright of note in London.

He had written ""Henry VI Part 1,"" ""Henry VI Part 2,"" ""Henry VI Part 3,"" ""The Two Gentlemen of Verona"" and ""Titus Andronicus"" by then, says the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust website.

Shakespeare is believed to have died on April 23, 1616, on what was possibly his 52nd birthday.
Following Shakespeare's death in 1616, actors from his works collected manuscripts and published them in 1623 as the ""First Folio,"" says the trust. The ""First Folio"" contained 36 of Shakespeare's plays.

White privilege? Jokic’s shoe deal throws cold water on Caitlin Clark narrative,"The usual suspects in the sports media are up in arms over Caitlin Clark signing an eight-figure shoe deal with Nike. The likes of Mike Freeman and Jemele Hill are fuming that Clark, a white woman, secured a shoe deal over other black women in the WNBA.
""No Black WNBA players have a signature shoe. Here’s why that's a gigantic problem,"" read the USA Today headline before suggesting a systemically racist marketplace cost Las Vegas Aces star A'ja Wilson her own signature show.
Wilson, in particular, has the accolades to warrant a shoe deal. We don't dispute that. Her résumé is extensive. She is a two-time WNBA champion, two-time league MVP, five-time All-Star, and an Olympic gold medalist.
However, the anti-white basketball brigade fails to acknowledge how the shoe business works. Shoe deals, like most endorsement deals, are contingent upon not accolades but marketability.
Case in point: Nikola Jokić.
Jokić has been the best player in the NBA for the past four seasons, as supported by his soon-to-be third MVP in that span. He is the reigning NBA Finals MVP. Jokić is re-writing regular season and playoff record books. Yet until this past December, Jokić was the only NBA MVP since Kobe Bryant in 2008 not to have his own signature shoe.
According to reports, Nike had no plans to build a shoe around Jokić. Nike instead focused on signing rookie Victor Wembanyama, the face of the brand's new ""Air Immersion Space"" sneakers.
Jokić ultimately had to settle for a deal with the Chinese shoe company 361 Degrees, a brand that can hardly keep pace with Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour.
Like A'ja Wilson, Jokic's résumé more than warrants a signature deal with a Big Three shoe brand. But also, like Wilson, he's not as marketable as other players with more lucrative endorsement deals.
If Nike, Adidas, or Under Armour thought they could make money on Jokić and/or Wilson – there would be a bidding war. There is not.
Here's why:
Jokić is foreign. He doesn't have the charismatic personality or jaw-dropping style of play compared to, say, Steph Curry, LeBron James, or Kevin Durant. A'ja Wilson is a WNBA player. Very few WNBA players crossover into the mainstream. She has not.
The lack of interest in a major shoe deal for Jokić throws cold water on the narrative that the marketplace favors white players. Get this: the last MVP before Jokić to not receive a signature show was Dirk Nowitzki, another white player.
Simply put, Nike didn't choose Caitlin Clark over Wilson because she's white. Nike chose Clark because she's the most preeminent female basketball player in at least two generations.
Race matters to the media. Shoe brands want to make money, at all costs and colors. LeBron James, Michael Jordan, and Steph Curry sell more shoes than any white athlete in this majority-white nation.
Perhaps Caitlin Clark can soon challenge that trio.
Clark moves television ratings, merchandise, and ticket sales. Wilson, and other black women in the WNBA, do not.
Caitlin Clark is Tiger Woods, Serena Williams, and Wayne Gretzky: a dominant athlete who transcends a niche sport. A'ja Wilson is Jokic: a dominant player whose stardom is limited to the confines of the sport in which they play.

Senate Investigation Uncovers Why Eventbrite Censored Riley Gaines,"It's no secret that tech companies have long made it one of their primary goals to enforce and promote their political ideologies.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, tech and social media censored accurate information critical of mask mandates or vaccine passports, because it contradicted what their ideology's preferred ""experts"" believed. Perhaps the most famous example was the blatant censorship of the Hunter Biden laptop story. Twitter, Facebook and others suppressed posts referencing the story because it was damaging to their preferred presidential candidate. Despite the original reporting being entirely accurate.
But it's not just these obvious examples where politically motivated censorship continues to raise its pernicious head. Late in 2023, the ticketing and promotional platform Eventbrite participated in one of the more egregious incidents of ideological discrimination. Eventbrite restricted the ability of OutKick's Riley Gaines to promote one of her speaking events, while allowing  promotion of Hamas-supporting events.

Now a massive new report from Senator Ted Cruz and the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation has revealed just how pernicious this censorship industrial complex has become. Detailing how companies like Eventbrite create purposefully vague terms and conditions, then rely on monstrously biased interpretations of their terms to justify shutting down individuals or events that they disagree with politically.

When Eventbrite removed the Gaines event from their platform, they provided little explanation of their decision making.
The company's chairman however, went on a series of extremist rants on Twitter, prompting a response from Gaines on the company's hypocrisy.
READ: Riley Gaines Hits Back At Eventbrite After Blatant Hypocrisy
Despite deleting some pro-Hamas events after they were exposed, there was never an explanation as to what Gaines had done, according to Eventbrite, to warrant her event being removed. Until now.
The Cruz report found that Eventbrite's entire rationale boiled down to tweets that the company found offensive. With one tweet in particular mentioned, largely because it accurately identified what makes women, women, within the context of concerns over violence in the Middle East as well as her stance on protecting women's sports.
""This October 10th (X/X), we're celebrating Real Women's Day,"" Gaines tweeted. ""Ya know, the kind that can give birth and breastfeed and menstruate and lack a Y chromosome. The only kind of women. Women are not menstruators, bleeders, chestfeeders, cervix-havers, uterus-owners, egg-producers, or people with birthing capacity. Women are just women. Adult human females. I would be remiss if I didn't specifically say this day should be used to celebrate and honor the girls and women squarely in harms way because of the violence that has broken out in the Middle East and everything it has led to.""
This scientifically accurate statement from Gaines was apparently just too much for the Eventbrite censorship team. The Senate Committee conducting the investigation asked Eventbrite about Gaines' statement. And the response was predictably ridiculous.
""The Committee asked Eventbrite whether Gaines’s statement in her October 10, 2023 post on X that ‘Real Women . . . lack a Y chromosome’ violated Eventbrite’s policy because it disparaged someone’s perceived gender,"" the report explains. ""Eventbrite replied that the post ‘speaks for itself.’""
Yes. Yes it does. Adult human females are women and women's spaces and competitions should be protected. Eventbrite disagrees with this, in defiance of science, because their institutional political ideology also disagrees with science.
It's a profound reminder of just how pernicious modern censorship has become, how broken our cultural discourse is and how far removed from sanity and reason many tech companies are. Gaines' post is an accurate representation of reality. How Eventbrite handled it ""speaks for itself."" And discredits the company even further.",Not Available,https://www.outkick.com/analysis/ted-cruz-senate-investigation-uncovers-tech-company-censorship-of-riley-gaines,S
'Mike and Ike' Candy Co. Working On Partnership with Knicks' Josh Hart,"New York Knicks guard Josh Hart runs around the court as if he's riding an hours-long sugar rush.
The Energizer Bunny of New York fueled the Knicks' electric win, 104-101, over the Philadelphia 76ers, which gave them a 2-0 series lead.
After the sweet win, Hart laid back in the postgame interviews with a box of Mike and Ike, casually eating the candies like he's in his living room.

Hart threw a Hail Mary on X, posting the video of his snacking session and asking the folks at Mike and Ike to start sending candy.
""Hopefully one day I’ll get a deal with Mike and Ike and get my face on a box lol,"" Hart posted.
His wish came true.
The execs at Mike and Ike apparently tuned into the thrilling Game 2 between the Knicks and Sixers.
In the 24 hours since Hart endorsed Mike and Ike, the candy company pledged to keep Hart's supply of candy stocked, thanks to the good word of mouth.
According to TMZ Sports, Mike and Ike teased a potential partnership with Hart.
""We always knew Josh had great taste!"" a Mike and Ike spokesperson told the outlet. ""Mike and Ike might be the secret to no breaks -- and we're honored to be a part of his pre- and post-game routine.""
Considering his usage rate, playing a whopping 48 minutes on Monday, Hart's going to need the sugary fuel to burn on the court.
Hart played the role of ‘hero,’ alongside ex-Villanova teammates and current Knicks teammates Jalen Brunson and Donte DiVincenzo.
The Knicks guard scored a team-high 21 points and secured 15 rebounds.
ESPN published a story before Game 2 detailing the difficult, almost physical relationship Knicks teammates Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo previously shared.
Known for his running battery and mouth, Josh Hart made some critics in his own locker rooms, notably at Villanova.
The story shared that Hart's hazing tactics led him to clash with Donte DiVincenzo, formerly his teammate at Nova.

DiVincenzo once swung a 10-lb. plate at Hart over a derogatory comment. The comment was not repeated by any of the eyewitnesses who spoke to ESPN about the teammates' past at Villanova.
Hart and DiVi have patched things up since their difficult college days. Now, Hart, DiVincenzo, and fellow Villanova grad Jalen Brunson are leading the Knicks toward a promising path in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.
NBA playoff teams that go up 2-0 have a 92.7 percent probability of winning the series.

Timberwolves Owner Purposefully Sabotaged Deal With Alex Rodriguez: REPORT,"The saga of ownership control over the Minnesota Timberwolves organization has become one of the most fascinating stories in sports.
Current majority owner Glen Taylor had seemingly reached an agreement to sell his majority stake in the team to another group led by Alex Rodriguez and Marc Lore. That agreement fell apart over the past few months, with Taylor saying that the Rodriguez-Lore group had missed a payment, allowing him to void the deal.
Rordriguez though, denied that statement, stating that they'd fulfilled their requirements.
READ: Alex Rodriguez Timberwolves Group Denies Statement, Says They Fulfilled Requirements
So what really happened?
A new report from Joe Pompliano on his Huddle Up Substack revealed more behind-the-scenes detail of how the relationship between Taylor, Rodriguez and Lore fell apart. And it sure sounds like Taylor decided to sabotage the deal intentionally.

According to Pompliano, the disagreements between the two parties started in large part because Rodriguez and Lore brought in Tim Connelly to run the basketball operations side of the Timberwolves.
Connelly was given a massive compensation package; $8 million per year over five years, as well as offered incentives based on the organization's performance financially during his tenure. Taylor reportedly hated paying a basketball operations executive that much money, and balked at giving him a version of equity in the business.
While Connelly was still eventually hired at the $8 million per year hire, the incentives were removed and fractures between Taylor, Rodriguez and Lore started to get deeper.
Sure enough, as Rodriguez and Lore got closer to completing the long-standing deal in 2024, Taylor then pulled the rug out from underneath them. After selling more of his stake to the new group, Taylor's stake had actually dropped below A-Rod and Lore's, making him one of the minority owners. But he came to a backroom agreement to buy nearly 3 percent more of the team from a limited partner, pushing again into control.
There's only one explanation for why he'd chose to do that when he was ostensibly selling the team anyway: because he had no intention of going through with the agreement. He effectively sabotaged the deal, regardless of whether or not Rodriguez and Lore had the money to complete it.
According to Pompliano, it seems likely that the two parties are heading for some sort of litigation. Next steps include mediation and arbitration, but even court proceedings aren't out of the question.
Taylor believes he has the ability to win; that his actions to terminate the agreement were correct. But Rodriguez and Lore won't go down easily, as their original purchase price now woefully undervalues the real world price of the Timberwolves.
The Connelly hire that started the disagreement has helped make Minnesota one of the NBA's best teams. And with a 1-0 series lead, pending the result of Tuesday night's game against the Phoenix Suns, the value and revenue of the team could only increase. And with Connelly able to get out of his contract after the season, there's a non-zero chance he leaves rather than deal with the uncertainty.
Regardless, it seems like this saga is a long way away from a conclusion. Stay tuned.",Not Available,https://www.outkick.com/sports/timberwolves-owner-purposefully-sabotaged-deal-with-alex-rodriguez-report,T
Brewers Pitcher Hospitalized After Taking Line Drive To The Neck,"Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Jakob Junis suffered a scary neck injury Monday afternoon during batting practice at PNC Park.
The Brewers anticipated a Monday matchup with the Pittsburgh Pirates. According to reports, Junis — currently on 15-day IL — ran onto the field and was struck in the neck area by a line drive.
An ambulance was called onto the warning track near right field at PNC Park, and the pitcher was loaded onto a medical backboard, according to Pirates writer Kevin Gorman.
Junis received medical assistance on the field for 15 minutes before the ambulance took him to a nearby hospital for further attention.

AMERICAN VALUES: Rural town fights for survival after factory closure leaves a third of residents unemployed,"Locals in Noel, Missouri, are struggling to find a path forward after Tyson Foods shut down a chicken processing plant that employed over 600 residents of the small town.
NOEL, Mo. – A small, rural town in the Ozarks is grappling with finding a path forward after a Tyson Foods Inc. plant closure left nearly a third of its residents jobless.
""The people around here are resilient,"" Noel Mayor Terry Lance told Fox News Digital. ""I think a lot of the time you become as resilient as you have to be, and I'm not sure that that's unique to small town America even.""
""I feel like I see more energy as far as people wanting the town to go in — at least what I believe is — the right direction, than I have seen for some time,"" he added.
The Missouri town, with a population of about 2,000, was dealt a devastating blow last year when Tyson announced it was shutting down its chicken processing plant located in the middle of town at the end of October. Tyson acquired the plant in 1998 after the company bought out Hudson Foods Inc., making it the largest employer in the county with 1,500 workers, including 650 Noel residents.

The mayor said when he first learned in August that Tyson was suspending operations, he worried that the loss of tax revenue coming from workers who shopped at local businesses would prevent the town from providing essential services for its residents.
""I was concerned, very concerned that we might lose up to 25% of our population,"" Lance said.
""Everyone was concerned about it,"" he continued. ""Along with the population that I was afraid we might lose, I was concerned that we might lose up to half of our small businesses.""
Initially, after the closure, the town lost over 300 residents, according to the mayor, including some Somali and South and Central American migrants who came to Noel on H1B visas to work at the plant.
Lance and McDonald County Chamber of Commerce President John Newby quickly organized several job fairs with dozens of companies based in northwest Arkansas and Oklahoma to find jobs for the locals left without work.
""It's like removing the auto industry from Detroit,"" Newby told Fox News. ""That’s what the impact was here in McDonald County.""

Jimi Lasiter worked at the plant for 11 years and her sister, Theresa Lasiter, had worked there for five when they heard about the closure.
""I panicked and started looking for jobs,"" Jimi told Fox News. ""It was hard to find anything.
She was unemployed for nearly six months until she finally secured a job at another nearby poultry plant. Theresa worked with a staffing agency for several months before finding another full-time position.
""It’s not easy to find anything around here that will pay anything,"" she said. ""You get someone wanting to pay $11, $12 an hour, but they’re 45 minutes away. How am I going to survive on that?""

TYSON FOODS HOPING TO HIRE THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS FOR LABOR-MANUFACTURING JOBS: REPORT
A Tyson Foods spokesperson told Fox News: ""Closing a plant is always a difficult decision, and we understand the impact it has on the team members and community. We encourage and support all team members to seek other roles at other Tyson Foods locations.""
Lance said population levels have started to rise back toward the level they were pre-closure. But the bigger challenge was the impact on local businesses, some of which have had to shutter their doors.
""Most of the businesses relied completely on Tyson,"" Theresa said. ""It was a complete shock for everybody.""
Without the Tyson workers spending money at local businesses, Noel’s sales tax revenue is down nearly 25% this year, according to Lance. The city council has had to slash several budgets, including the marshal's office.
But despite economic hardship, some people in town are happy about the closure and view it as an opportunity to rebuild Noel back into the lively tourist destination it was up until the 1990s.
Dustin Shurback owns several businesses in Noel and said he sees the town's future as ""tourism 365 days a year."" (Teny Sahakian/Fox News)
""It was a very pivotal moment with Tyson leaving,"" business owner Dustin Shurback said. ""The whole community was down and depressed, and sales were down.""
""I had just this burning feeling within me that said, ‘Hey, we're going to be okay. So, let's put on a good face and let's get to work,'"" he added.
Shurback, born and raised in Noel, owns three businesses in town: the Elk River Coffee Shop, the River Ranch Resort and a local ice cream parlor.
""Speaking from the tourism side of things, which is a ton of our revenue, I feel like it's a step in the right direction for the town of Noel,"" Shurback told Fox News. ""A large hit at first. I even felt it at my ice cream shop — our sales plummeted. It was pretty rough.""
""But I think as the community comes together and focuses its direction on tourism, I really feel like we can make a huge rebound without having a processing plant in town,"" he continued.
AMERICAN VALUES: SMALL TOWN MARSHAL DETAILS WHAT OTHER COPS CAN LEARN FROM HIS 'OLD SCHOOL' POLICING
Tyson Foods still owns the plant location and is seeking out potential buyers.
""We are always open to exploring opportunities and are willing to discuss a potential sale with any interested party, which we have already done in Dexter, MO in order to support our business and the community,"" the Tyson spokesperson told Fox News.
Many, like Shurback, believe Noel needs to capitalize on its unique location. Located in the southwest of the state with the Elk River running through it, the area surrounding Noel features caves and bluffs, making it a prime destination for tourists seeking an outdoorsy vacation.
Shurback said the smell from the poultry plant was a detractor to tourism, and the migrants employed by Tyson didn't care to keep the town clean or make an effort to become a part of the community.
In January, three months after the plant closure, he and several other local business owners came together and formed the Noel Revitalization Team, a nonprofit focused on bringing the community together and uplifting the town to make it more appealing to outsiders. Their first projects were organizing a community trash pickup and installing flagpoles on Main Street.
""I think as the community comes together and focuses its direction on tourism, I really feel like our town can make a huge rebound without having a processing plant,"" Shurback said.
Mayor Terry Lance said if the town can attract more tourism-based businesses, ""Noel can have a good future."" (Teny Sahakian/Fox News)
But there are some residents in town who don’t think tourism alone will be able to keep Noel alive.
""I don’t think that that type of economy is going to work anymore,"" Theresa said. ""It would be nice, but the only thing around here now for tourism is camping or the rivers.""
The Lasiter sisters said the dream of tourism year-round is unrealistic without new businesses coming into town.
""When we were kids, I remember there was a go-kart track and a movie theater. There was just tons of stuff to do. And now there's nothing,"" Jimi said.

The mayor, however, has faith that if the community capitalizes on its natural resources and can attract more businesses to town that offer art, crafts, food or music, Noel can foster a self-sustaining economy without relying on jobs from big business.
""As long as we have the bluffs and the healthy river system, Noel can have a good future,"" Lance said, ""It's there, we just need to take advantage of it.""

Crisis in the Northwest: City's battle against homelessness could have dire effects for the nation,"The Supreme Court on Monday will hear arguments in an Oregon case that West Coast cities argue has hamstrung their ability to address rampant homeless camps.
Homeless encampments could balloon nationwide or be cleared more aggressively in some states depending on how the Supreme Court rules on a case being argued Monday.
""I think people understand that we all need a safe place to live,"" Ed Johnson, director of litigation at the Oregon Law Center, told Fox News Digital. ""The worst way to work toward that shared goal … is to ticket and arrest people who are just trying to stay alive.""
Grants Pass v. Johnson asks whether some laws regulating camping on public property violate the Eighth Amendment's protection against cruel and unusual punishment.

CRISIS IN THE NORTHWEST: INSIDE ONE OF OREGON’S LARGEST HOMELESS CAMPS WITH A FORMER DRUG DEALER
The Oregon Law Center filed the original lawsuit in 2018 when plaintiff Debra Blake claimed Grants Pass, a Southern Oregon city of around 40,000 residents, was ""trying to run homeless people out of town"" by fining people for sleeping outside. Blake has since died and a different homeless woman, Gloria Johnson (no relation to Ed), took on the mantle.
""What the city has done and what they want to do is make it illegal for someone to cover themselves with a blanket so that they don't die of hypothermia, on every inch of city land, 24 hours a day,"" said Johnson, who will sit at the counsel table supporting a Washington D.C.-based attorney who will argue on behalf of homeless residents.
Theane Evangelis, who will argue for Grants Pass, disagreed with Johnson's characterization of the case.
""These laws are an important tool for cities,"" Evangelis said. ""They are a last resort, not a first resort, as cities try to get people the help that they need and to address the really immediate threats to health and safety.""
Just before the Grants Pass suit was filed, the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a different case, Martin v. City of Boise. Under the Eighth Amendment, cities can't enforce anti-camping ordinances if there aren't any shelter beds available, the court found.

DRUG RECRIMINALIZATION COULD SIGNAL CULTURAL SHIFT IN PROGRESSIVE STATE, PORTLAND TRIAL ATTORNEY SAYS
In 2020, a district court in Southern Oregon ruled Grants Pass' anti-camping ordinances were similarly a form of cruel and unusual punishment. Grants Pass appealed to the 9th Circuit, which encompasses nine Western states. There, a three-judge panel upheld the decision, writing that Grants Pass' regulations were unconstitutional in part because the number of homeless residents far outnumbers available shelter beds.
If the Supreme Court agrees with the lower courts, critics of Oregon's homeless policies have a dire warning for the rest of the nation.
""What's going on on the West Coast is what's coming to a neighborhood near you,"" Brian Bouteller, executive director of the Gospel Rescue Mission in Grants Pass, told Fox News.
Oregon's homeless population has grown 37.4% from 2020 to 2023, according to data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. At the same time, state and local spending on housing and other homeless services has skyrocketed.
The state has the second-highest percentage of homeless residents who are unsheltered (64.6%), behind only California (68%).
The 9th Circuit's decision ""caused widespread paralysis"" in cities' handling of homelessness and has had ""harmful effects"" up and down the West Coast, Evangelis said.
""These decisions are harming the very people they were meant to help,"" she said. ""It's unacceptable to leave people in dangerous encampments. It's unacceptable, as a society, for us to continue to condone this sort of human suffering.""
Encampments in places like Portland have been plagued by hygiene issues, drug overdoses, violence and fires. In 2021, nearly half of all fires in the city started in or near homeless camps, local media reported. At least 315 homeless people died in 2022 in Multnomah County, where Portland is located, according to a report from the county. About half of those deaths were from unintentional injury — mostly drug overdoses — and 8% were from homicide.
ALL ROADS 'LEAD BACK TO FENTANYL': CITY OVERRUN WITH DRUGS SEES PROGRESS AFTER OVERWHELMED POLICE GET NEW HELP
Leaders across the political spectrum, from Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in California, to a coalition of 24 Republican attorneys general, have filed briefs in support of Grants Pass, saying the 9th Circuit overstepped by wresting control of homelessness policy away from local governments.
State and local government officials often cite the Boise decision and Grants Pass case as reasons they can't get stricter about public camping. Johnson, the Oregon Law Center litigation director, said that's a cop-out.
""We've gotten ourselves into this fix through decades of failed policy that both parties have shared in,"" he said. ""I think that it's easier for politicians to blame a court decision, even if when you look at that decision, it makes no sense.""
The Grants Pass case is narrowly tailored and doesn't block cities from moving camps or banning tents, Johnson said, nor does it apply when there is available shelter space.
""If someone is offered shelter, and they decline it, they could still be ticketed and arrested under this decision,"" he said. ""In Grants Pass … there are no available shelter beds for people. And so that issue hasn't come up in Grants Pass itself.""
But Bouteller, who operates the city's only overnight homeless shelter, called Johnson's framing ""manipulative hogwash.""
The Gospel Rescue Mission offers 138 shelter beds in addition to a 12-bed women's transitional house, Bouteller said. The Christian nonprofit typically sheltered 500-700 individuals a year until the city's anti-camping ordinances were deemed unconstitutional.
Fewer people walked through the Gospel Rescue Mission's doors, and the population in the parks grew, Bouteller said.
""I have been at less than half full since 2020,"" he said.

Bouteller also rejected Johnson's claim that the case is solely about sleeping.
""It doesn't cost us tens of thousands of dollars every year to clean up after sleeping in our parks,"" he said. ""We're not afraid of our children playing in the playground and accidentally getting poked by someone's pillow.""
""This is an issue of vandalism. Human trafficking. Lots and lots of drug trafficking,"" he added.
Dr. Bruce Murray has worked in refugee camps across Asia, Africa and Europe, providing medical care to those who lack not only shelter, but basic safety.
The conditions he sees volunteering with the homeless in Grants Pass are shockingly similar — minor scrapes and pokes that can become life-threatening infections within a matter of days, untreated diabetes, heart disease and weather-related conditions like hypothermia, trench foot and even frozen limbs requiring amputation.
""Living outside in tents is not a joy,"" Murray said. ""And I think that's one of the myths is people choose to live this lifestyle. They're not the ones that I see.""
Murray and a team of volunteers drive a medical van to four parks, where much of the city’s growing homeless population have staked out tents. In a single day, they can provide basic care for minor wounds or chronic illnesses and triage patients with more severe needs. They can arrange follow-up visits and get to know people’s unique medical needs over time.
If the Supreme Court sides with Grants Pass, Murray worries the homeless patients he sees will scatter, possibly into the heavily-wooded mountains nearby, sparking additional concerns about wildfire risks.
""I worry that access to care … is going to be much more difficult to assure if they criminalize living in parks,"" he said. ""It’s not like they have anywhere else to go.""

CRISIS IN THE NORTHWEST: THE HOMESCHOOLING MOM DOCUMENTING PORTLAND'S 'DESTRUCTION'
Murray said the Gospel Rescue Mission does ""an excellent job of providing safe shelter"" and serves ""an important purpose.""
But the shelter has many rules for residents, including a ban on drugs and alcohol, mandating attendance at religious services and prohibiting men and women from cohabitating. Those restrictions don't work for everyone, he said.
And some people around the state have told Fox News Digital they prefer living outside, either because it gives them the freedom to do what they want or because they've been homeless so long they don't know any other way to live.
""I couldn't handle the four walls, the limitations and the lack of nature,"" Ressa, who has been homeless for around a decade, told Fox News Digitalin January. She has been living in a massive encampment in a park just across the river from the state capital in Salem.
A man named Seven, who has been homeless since 2006, concurred. ""I'm not used to"" being inside, he said.
While Bouteller agreed that the region needs more services, he said lack of shelter beds isn't the main issue.
""There's enough shelter beds for the folks that want to leave homelessness,"" he said. ""Those folks that are in the park … do not all want to leave homelessness.""
While the Grants Pass case has been playing out, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill in 2021 that requires local laws regulating sitting, lying and sleeping on public property to be ""objectively reasonable as to time, place and manner."" Then-House Speaker Tina Kotek, a Democrat who is now Oregon's governor, championed the bill.
In response, Portland leaders passed an ordinance banning people from blocking access to businesses or sidewalks with tents from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. The Oregon Law Center swiftly blocked the ordinance with a separate suit, alleging the restrictions violate the state constitution and existing laws.
Johnson declined to talk in detail about that ongoing case.

Retired teacher sues PA borough after he was convicted for putting 'for sale' sign in his truck window,"Will Cramer is suing the borough of Nazareth, Pennsylvania after he was convicted in a magistrate district court for putting a for-sale sign in his truck window.
A recently retired schoolteacher is suing his Pennsylvania borough over a local ordinance after he was found guilty of putting a ""for sale"" sign on his legally parked car.
""We put you in office as judges and state representatives to protect our rights,"" Will Cramer told Fox News Digital. ""And when we see things like giving people tickets for putting a for-sale sign in their car – violating our First Amendment right – it's sad.""
He teamed up with the Institute for Justice, filing a lawsuit on April 9 seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting his borough of Nazareth from enforcing the ordinance ""against a traditional, low-cost, and effective form of personal commercial speech.""
""I really can't think of a good reason why Nazareth has this policy in place,"" he said. ""I'm not quite sure why they would be so concerned about a car with the sign in the window.""

Cramer lived in Nazareth, a small borough in Northampton County, Penn., for over 40 years and spent the last 20 years teaching high school geometry and biology. At the start of the school year, he decided to retire in December 2023 and to go teach English in the Philippines for a year.
In October, Cramer planned to sell his 1987 Chevrolet truck as he prepared for his trip.
""I was retiring, and I was finally going to move to another country, so there was urgency to sell my truck,"" Cramer said. ""I wanted to sell some of my items and not take them with me. I didn't want to store them.""
But after failing to find any prospective buyers using online posts, Cramer decided to go old-school and put a ""for sale"" sign inside the window of the truck, which he parked on the street outside his house. He was unaware of Nazareth’s local ordinance that criminalizes having for-sale signs on vehicles that are otherwise parked legally on public streets.
A few days after placing the sign, he discovered a citation on his truck.
""When I pulled the ticket out from underneath the windshield wiper blade and I looked at it, I was actually receiving a ticket for putting a ‘for sale’ sign and then advertising my car for sale,"" Cramer said. ""I wasn't angry, I wasn't mad, I was just trying to take it in.""
""Like, is this for real? Am I getting a ticket for putting a for-sale sign on my truck?"" he added.

Cramer immediately removed the sign and began parking the truck on his lawn, since his house doesn't have a driveway. He luckily was able to sell the old Chevy to someone who had seen the sign before its removal and contacted him. In a rush to finish making arrangements for his January departure, Cramer originally chose not to fight the ticket and sent in a check for the amount owed.

""I just paid it, I wanted to get it over with,"" he said. ""And then I went back home to try to finish the rest of the things that I had to do to complete before I could leave.""
A little over a week later, Cramer noticed the check was returned along with a letter saying his payment was late and he owed additional late fees.
""At this point I got kind of angry because I thought it was bad enough that they violated my freedom of speech,"" he said. ""Now they want more money because they didn't get the ticket exactly on the date that they needed it.""
The retired teacher began researching criminal cases involving First Amendment rights and reaching out to individuals involved in cases similar to his. He pled not guilty to the citation and represented himself in magistrate's court, but ultimately was convicted and required to pay $123.75 in fines and court costs.
Cramer eventually pled guilty to the citation, but is now suing the borough of Nazareth for violating residents' Fist Amendment with its local ordinance.  (Institute for Justice/Will Cramer )

Cramer did not appeal that decision, but wants to sell another car of his, a 2009 Buick, when he returns to Nazareth from the Philippines next January.
The borough of Nazareth did not respond to a request for comment.

"Crisis in California: Migrant chaos on San Diego area beaches 'pretty scary,' local officials say","Illegal immigrants are increasingly risking the Pacific Ocean to sneak into the United States, endangering themselves and marine agents, according to border officials.
Leaders in the San Diego area called for stronger border enforcement Monday evening after a motorboat loaded with suspected illegal immigrants ran ashore on a Carlsbad beach over the weekend.
""We have no idea who they are, we have no idea where they are, and these people were not vetted at all,"" San Diego County Supervisor Jim Desmond said at a press conference Monday evening, calling the boat landing a ""coordinated effort.""
Video shared widely on social media showed a boat speeding between surfers before running ashore on Saturday. More than a dozen people jumped off the boat and ran into the city, with some hopping into waiting cars.

CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA: A $6,500 CARTEL TICKET AND A DREAM OF DRIVING FOR DOORDASH
Migrants have long sneaked into the U.S. by way of the Pacific Ocean, but over the last three years, California has seen an ""exponential increase in maritime smuggling,"" Brandon Tucker, director of Customs and Border Protection’s Air and Marine Operations in San Diego, said.
Since fiscal year 2020, maritime smuggling events — which can also include trafficking drugs and other contraband — in California have increased nearly 140%, according to CBP.

""If I’m seeing that in the harbor on the one time a year that I go out … you know it’s happening every single day,"" he said.
Desmond previously told Fox News it is ""untenable and unsustainable to have people just coming in and walking into neighborhoods from another country.""
""Quite frankly, it's pretty scary I would think, for the people living right along the coast,"" he said.

During Monday's press conference, Desmond and other leaders called for federal authorities to bolster border security.
""The chaos at the border and the fact that many of these crossers know there'll be no consequences here encourages this, and it makes our cities less safe,"" Oceanside Deputy Mayor Ryan Keim said, according to local news reports.
California state law bars local police from working with Border Patrol and other federal agencies to enforce immigration laws. Desmond said the latest viral boat landing shows that it's time to end ""incentives"" and sanctuary for illegal immigration.

New poll reveals voters prefer Trump on these key issues,"Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas has the latest as Pennsylvania gears up for its primary vote Tuesday on 'Fox Report.'
Most voters prefer former President Donald Trump to handle their top issues over President Joe Biden ahead of the 2024 election, recent polling shows.
A new NBC News poll found that inflation is the number one issue for voters going into November — an issue that most respondents believe would be better handled by Trump than the current president.
When asked who they preferred to handle the issue of rising costs, the majority of respondents, 52%, said they prefer Trump to Biden.
Only 30% of likely voters said that they believe Biden is better at leading on the issue.

The survey also found that the crisis at the southern border is the second most important issue to voters, another area where Biden was found to trail Trump.
When asked about their opinion of the president's handling of immigration and the crisis at the border, a whopping 69% of respondents said they disapprove of Biden's handling of the crisis.
REPORTER SOUNDS ALARM ON ‘TROUBLING NUMBERS’ FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN IN LATEST POLL: ‘A CLEAR LIABILITY’
The NBC poll from April did not ask respondents their current view of Trump's handling of the immigration crisis, but an NBC survey from January revealed that 57% of respondents preferred the former president's handling of the issue at the border over only 22% who favored Biden.

The poll also found that if the election were held today, Trump bests Biden by 2-points, 46% to 44%.
The results are the most recent in a string of polling that shows voters are not only most worried about the border and rising costs, but that they trust Trump to be the best presidential candidate to handle the issues.
Recent Fox News statewide surveys in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin mirrored the results that Trump is the preferred candidate to handle the issues of immigration and the economy over Biden.

Additionally, a recent Axios/Ipsos survey found that 42% of Latino voters believe Trump is good for the economy, while only 20% could say the same about Biden. On the issue of immigration, 29% of Latino respondents gave Trump a positive rating, over 22% who preferred Biden.

Biden launches billion-dollar climate work program as part of Earth Day actions,"'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts react to the White House renewing internal talks on invoking a climate emergency as activists push for action from President Biden.
President Biden officially launched the so-called American Climate Corps, a program that is slated to ""mobilize"" tens of thousands of Americans for conservation and eco-friendly projects nationwide.
The president's actions on the work program come on Earth Day and are part of broader actions the White House unveiled Monday to commemorate Earth Day. In addition to the American Climate Corps announcement, the White House touted recent regulations blocking off 13 million acres of federal land from future oil drilling and revealed $7 billion in grants for mainly state-level solar projects.
""Here’s the bottom line: President Biden laid out the most ambitious land and water conservation agenda in American history,"" White House Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory told reporters during a call about the administration's Earth Day actions. ""And he is delivering, already cementing a legacy as one of the nation’s strongest conservation presidents.""
""The groundbreaking corps represents, yet again, a way to make accessible the economic opportunity and upside that comes with tackling the climate crisis,"" added White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi. ""So, for young people of all backgrounds, no matter their qualification, no matter their ZIP code, there will now be pathways and positions that they can fill that help them gain the skills to succeed in the clean energy economy.""

Overall, the American Climate Corps will consist of 20,000 Americans who will work in a variety of roles combating climate change. The positions generally don't require previous experience and will be geared toward conservation, green energy and environmental justice work.
On Monday, the White House launched a new website for interested workers to apply for such roles. The site is expected to soon list 2,000 positions – such as field coordinator, forestry technician, hydrologic technician and land conservation crew member – located across 36 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico.
The White House said the overarching goal of the corps is to make it easy for any American to ""find work tackling the climate crisis while gaining the skills necessary for the clean energy and climate resilience workforce of the future."" It added the first class of the American Climate Corps will be deployed in June 2024.
BIDEN ADMIN PROBED AFTER FOX NEWS DIGITAL SHOWS IT MAY HAVE FABRICATED PAPER TRAIL TO SHUTTER CHEMICAL PLANT
""From day one, the president has seen the urgency of taking action on climate not just because of the situation it creates in our communities, represented in wildfires and floods and hurricanes, but also a profound sense of urgency to get American workers back in the game competing for the jobs of the future,"" a senior administration official told reporters.

Biden first took executive action to begin forming the government work program in September after facing pressure from progressives and environmental groups who had called for such an action. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the two architects of the Green New Deal, had led such calls among Democratic lawmakers.
According to a senior administration official, ahead of the announcement Monday, the White House held listening sessions with Markey and Ocasio-Cortez to hear from Americans interested in the program.
But the program has faced heavy criticism from Republicans who have argued congressional action is needed to move forward with it.

In an October letter, Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., and Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, expressed concern that it is unclear where funding for the program would be coming from.
""Unlike the Civilian Conservation Corps, which was implemented by President Roosevelt in response to an authorization in a law passed by Congress, the announcement of the program does not reference any legal authority giving rise to the program,"" they wrote.
Together, Comer and Sessions are spearheading an oversight investigation of the program.

"As Hawaiians struggle to find affordable housing after Lahaina wildfire, lawmakers reconsider vacation rentals","Oakland County, Michigan Sheriff Michael Bouchard on his community being targeted by transnational gangs.
Amy Chadwick spent years scrimping and saving as a single mother of two to buy a house in the town of Lahaina on the Hawaiian island of Maui. But after a devastating fire leveled Lahaina in August and reduced Chadwick's home to white dust, the cheapest rental she and her now-husband could find for their family and dogs cost $10,000 a month.
Chadwick, a fine-dining server, moved to Florida where she could stretch her homeowners insurance dollars. She’s worried Maui’s exorbitant rental prices, driven in part by vacation rentals that hog a limited housing supply, will hollow out her tight-knit town.
Most people in Lahaina work for hotels, restaurants and tour companies and can’t afford $5,000 to $10,000 a month in rent, she said.
MAUI FIRE REPORTS: KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE DEADLIEST US WILDFIRE IN OVER A CENTURY
""You’re pushing out an entire community of service industry people. So no one’s going to be able to support the tourism that you’re putting ahead of your community,"" Chadwick said by phone from her new home in Satellite Beach on Florida’s Space Coast. ""Nothing good is going to come of it unless they take a serious stance, putting their foot down and really regulating these short-term rentals.""
The Aug. 8 wildfire killed 101 people and destroyed housing for 6,200 families, amplifying Maui's already acute housing shortage and laying bare the enormous presence of vacation rentals in Lahaina. It reminded lawmakers that short-term rentals are an issue across Hawaii, prompting them to consider bills that would give counties the authority to phase them out.
Gov. Josh Green got so frustrated he blurted out an expletive during a recent news conference.

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson, File)
""This fire uncovered a clear truth, which is we have too many short-term rentals owned by too many individuals on the mainland and it is b———t,"" Green said. ""And our people deserve housing, here.""
Vacation rentals are a popular alternative to hotels for those seeking kitchens, lower costs and opportunities to sample everyday island life. Supporters say they boost tourism, the state's biggest employer. Critics revile them for inflating housing costs, upending neighborhoods and contributing to the forces pushing locals and Native Hawaiians to leave Hawaii for less expensive states.
This migration has become a major concern in Lahaina. The Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, a nonprofit, estimates at least 1,500 households — or a quarter of those who lost their homes — have left since the August wildfire.
The blaze burned single family homes and apartments in and around downtown, which is the core of Lahaina's residential housing. An analysis by the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization found a relatively low 7.5% of units there were vacation rentals as of February 2023.
Lahaina neighborhoods spared by the fire have a much higher ratio of vacation rentals: About half the housing in Napili, about 7 miles north of the burn zone, is short-term rentals.
Napili is where Chadwick thought she found a place to buy when she first went house hunting in 2016. But a Canadian woman secured it with a cash offer and turned it into a vacation rental.
Also outside the burn zone are dozens of short-term rental condominium buildings erected decades ago on land zoned for apartments.
In 1992, Maui County explicitly allowed owners in these buildings to rent units for less than 180 days at a time even without short-term rental permits. Since November, activists have occupied the beach in front of Lahaina's biggest hotels to push the mayor or governor to use their emergency powers to revoke this exemption.
Money is a powerful incentive for owners to rent to travelers: a 2016 report prepared for the state found a Honolulu vacation rental generates 3.5 times the revenue of a long-term rental.
State Rep. Luke Evslin, the Housing Committee chair, said Maui and Kauai counties have suffered net losses of residential housing in recent years thanks to a paucity of new construction and the conversion of so many homes to short-term rentals.
""Every alarm bell we have should be ringing when we’re literally going backwards in our goal to provide more housing in Hawaii,"" he said.
In his own Kauai district, Evslin sees people leaving, becoming homeless or working three jobs to stay afloat.
The Democrat was one of 47 House members who co-sponsored one version of legislation that would allow short-term rentals to be phased out. One objective is to give counties more power after a U.S. judge ruled in 2022 that Honolulu violated state law when it attempted to prohibit rentals for less than 90 days. Evslin said that decision left Hawaii's counties with limited tools, such as property taxes, to control vacation rentals.
Lawmakers also considered trying to boost Hawaii's housing supply by forcing counties to allow more houses to be built on individual lots. But they watered down the measure after local officials said they were already exploring the idea.
Short-term rental owners said a phase-out would violate their property rights and take their property without compensation, potentially pushing them into foreclosure. Some predicted legal challenges.
Alicia Humiston, president of the Rentals by Owner Awareness Association, said some areas in West Maui were designed for travelers and therefore lack schools and other infrastructure families need.
""This area in West Maui that is sort of like this resort apartment zone — that’s all north of Lahaina — it was never built to be local living,"" Humiston said.
One housing advocate argues that just because a community allowed vacation rentals decades ago doesn't mean it still needs to now.

""We are not living in the 1990s or in the 1970s,"" said Sterling Higa, executive director of Housing Hawaii's Future. Counties ""should have the authority to look at existing laws and reform them as necessary to provide for the public good.""
Courtney Lazo, a real estate agent who is part of Lahaina Strong, the group occupying Kaanapali Beach, said tourists can stay in her hometown now but many locals can't.
""How do you expect a community to recover and heal and move forward when the people who make Lahaina, Lahaina, aren’t even there anymore?"" she said at a recent news conference as her voice quivered.

"In the new Portland, legalized hard drugs are out, business is in","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
After three years of legalized hard drugs and rampant overdose deaths in Portland, Oregon, lawmakers this month rightly said enough is enough. There is a better option: strong progressive economic policies and ending untethered drug use promises to help repair the Portland image, attract new businesses and retain others downtown. This new more pragmatic progressivism we see shows a major shift in our state.
Governor Tina Kotek and the Democratic-majority legislature decisively steered away from ultra-progressive drug policies this year. The state’s evolution reflects an increasing recognition among bipartisan policymakers of the need for practical solutions to address challenging social issues while becoming a more business-friendly state. And I have seen this work before.
I hail from Detroit and contributed to the city’s post-bankruptcy restructuring, which is currently drawing in investors, innovators and young adventurers. Coming to Portland, I was struck by the similarities between my new city today with that of my youth in Detroit's Cass Corridor.

This was exacerbated by voter-approved Measure 110 which ushered in the most lenient drug laws in the nation in attempt to encourage drug treatment and cut down addictions. Despite the well-meaning intentions of Portland voters, the unintended outcomes have been severe.
Like Detroit, beneath visible urban challenges, Portland pulsates with vitality. Greater Portland boasts an extraordinary industrial base, fosters the education of trailblazers, and remains a strategic West Coast location for any sector.
The repeal of Measure 110, effective September 1, signals a commitment to growth, creating a safer and more conducive business climate. Unfortunately, Measure 110’s failures reminded Portlanders of the importance of basic order to maintain a city's quality of life.
And when polls this year showed 56% of voters favored repealing the measure, bipartisan legislators went for it, allowing local governments and law enforcement agencies the option to arrest or pursue substance abuse treatment for hard drug users. Kotek's leadership here mirrors Portland's metamorphosis, as she emerges as a centrist West Coast leader.
Her work to allocate $240 million in tax incentives to 15 semiconductor companies also underscores Portland’s dedication to embracing change and propelling progress in ways it simply had not done before to attract business. In June 2023, the state had approximately $11 million in cash incentives available for companies expanding their footprint in the state.
Oregon’s political shift on tax incentives has solidified greater Portland’s position as the nation’s leading location in the semiconductor sector, shaping America’s new economy in this critical industry that employs 40,000 people in the region.
Moreover, this strategic move aligns seamlessly with the overarching federal effort for manufacturing investment, most notably from the CHIPS Act. Last December, the governor led a Portland central city task force of public and private sector leaders. We created solutions to the city’s more pressing challenges and a long-term strategic vision for economic prosperity for the region.

Recently, Portland city council introduced an innovative Downtown Business Incentives Credit Program, expanded enterprise zones, and is exploring new Tax Increment Financing districts, signifying a turning point in the economic posture of the city nestled between the majestic Cascade Mountains and the tranquil vineyards of the Willamette Valley.
Combined, these new incentives and the reversal of legalized open-air hard drug use show a region committed to turning the page on three years of economic uncertainty. With these changes, business leaders can now confidently consider expanding in the Portland area, knowing that favorable policies are in place to support their success.
Driving down drug use and crime creates economic wins. In Detroit, policies like these ended much of the dilapidation I witnessed in my youth. That city now experiences high-priced condos, retail, and the newly erected Little Caesars Arena (home to two of the city’s pro sports teams, the Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Pistons).

Oregon’s political shift on tax incentives has solidified greater Portland’s position as the nation’s leading location in the semiconductor sector, shaping America’s new economy in this critical industry that employs 40,000 people in the region.

As someone who talks to corporations seeking fresh industrial land, high-value talent, and a high quality of life, the repeal of Measure 110 will help further reposition Portland once again as the Pacific Northwest’s prime choice for business. My new hometown of Portland is charting a course toward once again being the West Coast's best value for business.

Fox News host Jesse Watters questions the legal standing of the gag order on former President Trump in the NY vs. Trump trial Tuesday on ""Jesse Watters Primetime.""
JESSE WATTERS: The trial of the century. Day six, the crime the Democrats still haven't named. They call it ""hush money."" We call it a pawn star shakedown. Nothing in the law calls either illegal.
Trump's free speech went on trial today. Democrat prosecutors want the former president fined for talking – $1,000 a pop. Something tells me that won't make it stop. [Manhattan District Attorney Alvin] Bragg's begging the judge to gag the Republican nominee for president from talking. The prosecutor complaining, he did it right here in the hallway outside. Oh, no! Right in the hallway outside.
DA ALVIN BRAGG'S CASE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP IS 'HISTORIC MISTAKE': NEW YORK TIMES GUEST ESSAY
You have one president who acts like he's gagged, never talks, and you have another president who, let's face it, a little gagging sometimes wouldn't hurt him. But it's unconstitutional. Democrat judges and prosecutors can't make up charges just to muzzle Republicans in election season. …
…
They could put Rachel Maddow on the jury, and Trump still wouldn't be allowed to talk about it. They could bring Bigfoot in as a witness. And Trump would be fined for saying Bigfoot's real. The trial's first witness, the man who ran the National Enquirer, David Pecker. He testified that he's helped catch and kill negative stories about Trump for years, which isn't illegal, the last time we checked. And since it's been going on before Trump was a candidate. It proves the arrangement was personal and not a campaign violation. That should blow up the prosecution's case right there. …
….
The star witness of the trial of the century [Michael Cohen] is allowed to narrate the case, but the actual star, the defendant, can't. Trump can't live tweet the trial of the century, but every reporter and witness can. This is a political show trial that Trump's not even allowed to describe.

"LAURA INGRAHAM: From day one, Alvin Bragg was on a political mission, not a legal one","Fox New host Laura Ingraham exposes the truth behind the 'sham' NY vs. Trump trial on 'The Ingraham Angle.'
Fox News host Laura Ingraham lays out the ""conspiracy of dunces"" in her opening monologue Tuesday on ""The Ingraham Angle.""
LAURA INGRAHAM: From day one, Alvin Bragg was a man on a political, not a legal, mission. It was to charge Trump with whatever just to keep him in court. Maybe, maybe, get lucky and get a conviction. The truth is the underlying conduct doesn't even merit a misdemeanor charge because there is no intent to defraud without a federal crime in this case. This is a political hit job being run by one of Biden's DOJ's former top officials. Are we to actually believe that the lead prosecutor, Matthew Colangelo, just so happened to land this job at this time by accident? All right. One of the former top officials in the Biden DOJ? This has Biden's fingerprints all over it.
TRUMP TRIAL TO RESUME WITH GAG ORDER ARGUMENTS, TESTIMONY FROM EX-NATIONAL ENQUIRER PUBLISHER
It is all a sloppy mess to boot. Colangelo is trying to convince the jury that the case is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up. Trump, David Pecker and Michael Cohen, former Trump attorney, formed a conspiracy, he argued, to influence the election. Well, this guy's a piece of work. Colangelo should be sanctioned for trying to argue that there's a conspiracy here when he never charged Trump with a conspiracy. You can't prove this case without proving the facts on federal election law. And this is not a big revelation to any of you, but state courts have no jurisdiction over federal election law matters. I think it's becoming clear to all of you now.
Plus, if they were going to start charging conspiracies to affect an election, I have a question. Why wasn't Hillary Clinton and Fusion GPS charged under that same theory? The setup, the surveillance of Trump, the salacious and unverified Steele Dossier. All of it. For goodness sakes, $1 million went from the Clinton campaign and the DNC to a law firm, Perkins Coie, that funneled it to Steele, who then dug up the dirt.

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said President Biden has a ""duty"" to protect Jewish students on New York City college campuses if law enforcement, Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul will not crack down on the increasingly hostile anti-Israel protests overtaking campuses there.
Anti-Israel NYU students staged a walkout on Tuesday after a night of violent protests that resulted in over 100 people being arrested. Video shows demonstrators hurling bottles at NYPD officers who were sent to the scene to disperse a large, unruly crowd.
Violence has also spilled out at Columbia University, resulting in in-person classes being canceled due to concerns for students' safety.
Appearing on ""America Reports,"" on Tuesday, Cotton urged the NYPD to exercise its ""obligation"" and ""right"" to protect citizens and arrest people breaking the law on the university's campus.

Cotton argued that if neither Adams nor Hochul would step up to protect Jewish students, Biden needed to take action.
""Joe Biden has a duty to protect these Jewish students,"" he told Fox News' Sandra Smith. ""These are scenes like you've seen out of 1930s in Germany that should never be witnessed or tolerated here in America, in 2024.""
Hochul has thus far resisted pressure to send in the National Guard to quell the anti-Israel protests on campus.
Cotton also called on the Biden administration to deport any foreign student engaging in these disruptive demonstrations.
""Any of these students who are foreigners, here on visas, should immediately have their visas revoked by the Biden administration and promptly deported,"" he said.
""They have no right to be here, they certainly have no right to be here spewing antisemitic and anti-Israel filth.""

Cotton further questioned who is funding these protests and called on the Department of Justice to ""get to the bottom of it.""
""They don't look just spontaneous to me, when they are sitting out there in $500 camping tents,"" he remarked.
Cotton and other Republican senators sent a letter on Tuesday demanding the Biden administration address the escalating antisemitic encampments on college campuses and ""prosecute the mobs who have perpetuated violence and threats against Jewish students.""
Biden was accused of equivocating on the anti-Israel protests on Monday after he told reporters, ""I condemn the antisemitic protests. That’s why I have set up a program to deal with that. I also condemn those who don't understand what's going on with the Palestinians.""

"Jillian Michaels says evidence 'irrefutable,' trans athletes should not compete against girls","The celebrity fitness trainer joins ""Fox & Friends"" to discuss West Virginia middle school students protesting a transgender athlete and to give her take on America's obesity crisis.
Celebrity fitness trainer Jillian Michaels spoke out Tuesday in favor of fairness in women's sports after several middle school students in West Virginia staged a protest against one of their competitors, a natural-born male.
Michaels said the data supporting men's strength as superior to women is ""irrefutable"" during ""Fox & Friends,"" even when accounting for cross-sex hormone therapy.
DAWN STALEY MEDIA COVERAGE MAY HAVE INFLUENCED ANSWER ON TRANS ATHLETES IN WOMEN'S SPORTS, OUTKICK WRITER SAYS
""You've got two competing goals in sports. … One is inclusion, which everybody can understand and get on board with. However, the second goal that's in direct opposition with inclusion in this instance is going to be a fair competition,"" Michaels said on Tuesday.
""And if that's your priority, if your overriding priority is going to be fairness over inclusion, you've got to turn to the data, and the data irrefutably shows that biological males are 10 to 30% stronger, faster, have better endurance, better aerobic capacity across the board.""
At least five middle school girls refused to compete at the Harrison County Championships track meet last week after a transgender female won her shot put competition by three feet, according to the New York Post.
The 13-year-old won the competition despite five girls from a rival school refusing to throw in protest of her participation.

The protest comes after a federal appeals court ruled that transgender girls could not be barred from competing in West Virginia.
""If we defer to the studies, and I sent several to your producers … they show that even on puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, the decrease in physical performance is, quote, trivial. That's what the data says,"" Michaels said.
""And to give you an example, if you look at a biological male transgender female with grip strength in conjunction with a biological female transgender male – OK, so both of them are on blockers and cross-sex hormones – the transgender female, the biological male's grip strength was 17% greater than the female on testosterone and puberty blockers,"" she continued.
The eighth-grader reportedly takes puberty blockers and has identified as female for years.

OutKick host Charly Arnolt praised the girls for refusing to compete, saying their stance is the only way to spark change and protect fairness in women's sports.
""It's really upsetting that these middle school girls have to forfeit their opportunities in order to take a stand,"" Arnolt said earlier during ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday. ""That takes a lot of courage, especially at that age, but they're doing this for the greater good. It's not just for themselves.""
""These girls decided, ‘You know what? We want to make sure that people are paying attention.’ This is the only way and the only way for … the government to really start paying attention, and especially that federal appeals court that just struck down the law in West Virginia that bans transgender athletes from competing in female sports,"" she continued.
""It's the only way they're going to start saying, ‘OK, maybe we are doing something incorrectly here.’""

‘Squad’ member survives challenge from centrist Democrat after anti-Israel rhetoric threatened re-election,"Fox News' Bryan Llenas explains the 'uncommitted' threat facing President Biden as Pennsylvania primary voters head to polls.
A member of the far-left ""Squad"" survived a challenge from a centrist Democrat on Tuesday despite her sharp criticism of Israel that threatened her effort to win re-election in a district with a sizable Jewish community.
Rep. Summer Lee, a first-term congresswoman, will once again be the Democrat nominee to represent Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, after defeating local councilwoman Bhavini Patel.
Lee's victory follows that of fellow ""Squad"" member Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., in 2022, when she was nearly ousted in her own primary after making controversial remarks about police and Israel throughout her political career.

The race was viewed as an early test of how progressive Democrats critical of Israel might perform with voters as the party faces a continued divide over support for one of America's closest allies in the Middle East amid continued Gaza military operations in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack.
Since the attack and the war's escalation, Lee had called for a ceasefire and opposed sending more funding to Israel.
She had come under fire in recent months from pro-Israel groups and the Jewish community for her rhetoric on the war, including an open letter signed by dozens of rabbis condemning her ""divisive rhetoric"" they said had been ""perceived as openly antisemitic.""

While campaigning, Patel framed Lee's anti-Israel stance as part of a left-wing politics too extreme for the people of the district, and argued it ran in contrast to President Biden's agenda as he faces his own challenge of winning Pennsylvania against former President Donald Trump in November.
The issue of antisemitism was a particularly potent issue in the 12th district because it is home to the synagogue where a gunman killed 11 congregants in 2018, the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.

Lee's victory helped her avoid being the first House Democrat incumbent to lose a primary this year. Other ""Squad"" members are also expected to face tough primary challenges from centrist Democrats, including Reps. Cori Bush, D-Mo., Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.

"Crucial Senate showdown in key battleground state officially underway as Casey, McCormick win primaries","'Fox & Friends Weekend' co-hosts go 'off the wall' to break down the upcoming 2024 election calendar and preview key dates and battleground races.
It's officially game on in Pennsylvania, as Republican candidate Dave McCormick and Democratic Sen. Bob Casey Jr. were projected the winners of the two major party Senate primaries in the northeastern battleground state.
Both candidates, who were unopposed in Tuesday's Democratic and GOP primaries, will now face off in a high-profile and expensive Senate showdown that is one of a handful across the country which will likely decide whether the GOP wins back the Senate majority.
McCormick, a former hedge fund executive, West Point graduate, Gulf War combat veteran and Treasury Department official in former President George W. Bush’s administration, is making his second straight bid for the Senate.

He was part of a crowded and combustible battle for the 2022 GOP nomination. He ended up losing the nomination by a razor-thin margin to celebrity doctor and cardiac surgeon Mehmet Oz, who secured a primary victory thanks to a late endorsement from former President Donald Trump. Oz ended up losing the general election to then-Democrat Lt. Gov. John Fetterman.
This time around, McCormick faced no major opposition in the GOP primary. He was backed last year by longtime Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell as well as the Pennsylvania GOP, and was encouraged to run by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is the party's Senate campaign arm.
TRUMP MAKES MAJOR ENDORSEMENT IN KEY SENATE RACE
McCormick endorsed Trump early last month after the former president scored major victories in the coast to coast Super Tuesday contests and Nikki Haley – Trump's last remaining rival for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination – dropped out of the White House race.
Trump, the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, returned the favor earlier this month, endorsing McCormick.

Casey, the son of a popular former governor, is running for a fourth six-year term in the Senate. He served a decade as Pennsylvania's auditor general and then treasurer before winning election to the Senate in 2006.

The most recent public opinion polls indicate Casey holding a single-digit advantage over McCormick.
Democrats currently control the U.S. Senate with a 51-49 majority, but Republicans are looking at a favorable Senate map this year, with Democrats defending 23 of the 34 seats up for grabs.
Three of those seats are in red states that Trump carried in his 2020 election defeat to President Biden — Ohio, Montana and West Virginia, where Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin is not running for re-election. And Pennsylvania is one of five key general election battlegrounds where the Democrats are defending seats. Democrats may also have to worry about holding the open Senate seat in blue Maryland, where former GOP Gov. Larry Hogan is running.

Conservative group builds ‘America First’ coalition to fight 'radical left's extreme positions and agenda',"America First Works has united a coalition of conservative groups dedicated to spreading a winning message and fighting together ahead of the 2024 presidential election.
An organization working to advance the ""America First"" agenda has united a diverse coalition of conservative groups to fight together ""against the radical left's extreme positions and agenda"" ahead of the 2024 presidential election.
Led by America First Works, a 501c4 that's closely aligned with the America First Policy Institute (AFPI) and promotes an ""America First"" agenda through policy and legislation, the coalition was constructed earlier this month during a meeting in the nation's capital, where a pledge to work together was signed.
""On April 3rd, America First Works hosted a meeting at the Willard Hotel, which is historic in and of itself – Martin Luther King refined his speech [there], Abraham Lincoln was there – and brought together over 50 organizations, over 100 people, to just sit down and discuss how we can best work together,"" Ashley Hayek, who serves as the executive director at America First Works and the chief engagement officer at America First Policy Institute, told Fox News Digital about the ""historic"" meeting.
""For the first time since Reagan's presidency, [we brought] all of the groups together to work together and to commit that we would coordinate moving forward, whether it's early vote or ballot harvesting where it's legal, mobilization, [or] election integrity,"" she added.

Titled ""United We Win,"" the pledge was signed by dozens of conservative groups with wide-ranging interests who share common goals: To reclaim ""our nation's narrative,"" to ""win the argument"" ahead of the presidential election, and ""saving America.""
Those who signed the pledge vowed to ""work together as never before"" as they ""harness our collective resources, wisdom, and energy to educate like never before, to grow our coalition with unwavering dedication, and to advance conservative solutions that will steer our country back toward prosperity, security, and freedom.""
""Our mission is clear: reclaim our nation's narrative, win the argument, hold our elected officials accountable, and begin the work of healing and rebuilding,"" the pledge reads. ""Each member organization promises to contribute fully towards our shared goal. We will combine our energies, budgets, and abilities, leaving no stone unturned, no resource untapped, and no citizen unengaged.""
Celebrating the diversity of the groups that pledged their support, Hayek insisted this was the ""first step"" in ensuring a successful election year.
""You have Rebecca Weber, the CEO of AMAC [Association of Mature American Citizens]. It's a group very similar to AARP, but for conservative seniors. You have groups like Ralph Reed's Faith and Freedom Coalition, who are mobilizing across the country. You also have groups like Bienvenido that focuses on Hispanic outreach,"" she said.
""This was the first step in bringing everyone together and to have conversations about what this year looks like, how we reclaim the narrative, how we win messaging, how we push back together against the radical left's extreme positions and agenda,"" Hayek added.
Other groups that attended the meeting and signed onto the pledge, Hayek said, included Tea Party Patriots Action and Turning Point Action.
""All of our groups have different missions that are very unique, but we all have the same goal of wanting to make America first and to save our country,"" Hayek said. ""Making sure that we are all talking together, working together, understanding what each group is doing, is really the first step. That was accomplished by signing that pledge and committing to each other that we will unite like we have never united before.""
Pointing to early voting efforts that are being championed by the coalition, Hayek highlighted the fact that ""life happens"" and noted that some circumstances may prevent people in certain areas of the country from getting to the polls on Election Day.

""If you look at what just recently happened in New York in this special election, you had a snowstorm. Those that did not vote early were not able to possibly cast their ballot. You look at what happened in Reno in 2022 – and it's a very important Senate race – there was a freak snowstorm that came through and people were not able to cast their ballot,"" she said. ""While I think most of us agree that there should be Election Day only, no mail ballots, one vote, one person, complete clear rule of the law voting, that's not reality.... We need to use every tool possible to reach voters, and get people to vote early.""
Hayek noted that conservatives should be taking advantage of mailing in their ballots early in states where it's permitted, as she stressed the importance of ""getting caught up with the times, modernizing our tactics, working together, and turning out the vote.""
""Conservatives and the America First movement, we are on the right side of policies. We are for families, we are for hardworking Americans, we have policy plans that change hearts and minds. We actually saw that in 2022.… We saw historic numbers, increases in Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, suburban women who supported conservative causes,"" Hayek said. ""Now we just need to implement the tactics to make sure we're turning out our votes in the right places so that we can save our country.""
Hayek also spoke briefly about the AFPI's Pathway to 2025 initiative, which she described as a ""five pillar plan"" that's ""really simple.""
She said the effort, which is being led by former New York GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin, is about ""messaging and data, it's unifying the movement, it's project 19, focusing on the counties that we believe will ultimately determine the next election, it's our ballot harvesting and voter mobilization, and then, of course, day one of what a new administration looks like.""
""By the way, the day one of the new administration, that's not just a White House. It's also in our states… how we can we have a big impact at even at the school board level,"" she added.
Asked about the plan and how it would work as far as the replacement of certain individuals or groups who are already a part of the government, Hayek said, ""That team has assembled over 600 volunteers that have done deep dives into each one of the departments to determine best practices, so they can hit the ground running on day one of a new administration.""

""That work is so important because it's something that the left has done incredibly well and something that, as conservatives, we can do so much better,"" she said.

Recognizing that the ""conservative movement has been outspent,"" Hayek said she's confident ""we will not be outsmarted.""
""Right now, it's very clear that the America First movement, the conservative movement, is focused,"" she added. ""They're dedicated to working together.""

DA Alvin Bragg's case against Donald Trump is 'historic mistake': New York Times guest essay,"Fox News legal editor Kerri Kupec Urbahn joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss her key takeaways from Trump's trial in New York City as a judge is set to decide whether the former president violated his gag order.
Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's case against former President Trump is a ""historic mistake,"" a law professor argued in an opinion piece published Tuesday.
In a New York Times guest essay, Boston University law professor Jed Handelsman Shugerman argued Bragg was overreaching in his attempts to try a federal election crime under New York state law. He said the Manhattan's DA allegation against Trump was ""vague"" since the prosecution failed to specify ""an election crime or a valid theory of fraud.""
Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records in relation to alleged hush money payments made to pornography actress Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 election. The presumptive GOP presidential nominee returned to court Tuesday as the trial continues, Fox News Digital reported.

GOV GAVIN NEWSOM WORRIES ABOUT ‘OVERINDULGENCE,’ ‘OBSESSION’ WITH TRUMP HUSH MONEY TRIAL: ‘LESS IS MORE’
Shugerman suggested Bragg should instead center his argument around the idea that ""it's not the crime; it's the cover-up"" and pointed to allegedly falsified business records.
""Most of them were entered in early 2017, generally before Mr. Trump filed his Federal Election Commission report that summer. Mr. Trump may have foreseen an investigation into his campaign, leading to its financial records. Mr. Trump may have falsely recorded these internal records before the FEC filing as consciously part of the same fraud: to create a consistent paper trail and to hide intent to violate federal election laws, or defraud the FEC,"" Shugerman wrote.
However, the law professor noted Bragg's filing and Monday's opening statements do not indicate prosecutors were following this approach. He also conceded that his own explanation could also have ""significant legal problems.""
Bragg's election interference theory is ""weak,"" Shugerman wrote. ""As a reality check, it is legal for a candidate to pay for a nondisclosure agreement.""

TRUMP SAYS CRIMINAL TRIAL IS HAVING 'REVERSE EFFECT' AS HE CAMPAIGNS AT NEW YORK BODEGA, VOWS TO SAVE CITY
Shugerman also raised three problems with Bragg's effort to try a federal crime in a state court. The first, he wrote, was that there was no previous case of ""any state prosecutor relying on the Federal Election Campaign Act,"" which he called an ""overreach.""
The second issue he raised was that the prosecutors didn't cite judicial precedents involving the criminal statute at hand.
""Mr. Trump’s lawyers argued that the New York statute requires that the predicate (underlying) crime must also be a New York crime, not a crime in another jurisdiction. The Manhattan DA responded with judicial precedents only about other criminal statutes, not the statute in this case. In the end, they could not cite a single judicial interpretation of this particular statute supporting their use of the statute,"" Shugerman wrote.
The third problem was that precedent in New York did not allow ""an interpretation of defrauding the general public,"" Shugerman wrote.

Shugerman said it was reasonable to question whether the case against Trump was about ""Manhattan politics"" rather than New York law.
""This case is still an embarrassment of prosecutorial ethics and apparent selective prosecution,"" Shugerman concluded, adding that Trump could win in appellate courts if he is convicted. ""But if Monday’s opening is a preview of exaggerated allegations, imprecise legal theories and persistently unaddressed problems, the prosecutors might not win a conviction at all.""

Tennessee teachers step closer to carrying firearms in classroom after state lawmakers pass GOP-backed bill,"Fox News co-host Pete Hegseth has the latest on Nashville police department confirming it will release the trans shooter manifesto on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'
Tennessee lawmakers overwhelmingly passed a GOP-backed bill on Tuesday that will allow schoolteachers to carry firearms on school grounds, though the names of the armed instructors would not be published to the public.
Earlier this month, Republican lawmakers in Tennessee joined together to approve Senate Bill 1325 with a 26-5 vote. The bill allows a teacher or faculty member who meets certain requirements, to possess and carry a firearm on school grounds.
In order to carry a handgun, teachers must have a handgun carry permit, have written authorization from both the school’s principal and local law enforcement and undergo 40 hours of handgun training. The worker must also not be prohibited from purchasing, possessing and carrying a handgun under Tennessee or federal law, as determined by a background check.
On Tuesday, the House in the state Legislature continued to push the bill closer to becoming law by passing the sister bill by a 68-28 vote. It now heads to Gov. Bill Lee’s desk to be signed into law.
TENNESSEE LAWMAKERS PASS BILL ALLOWING TEACHERS TO CARRY GUNS AT SCHOOL 1 YEAR AFTER DEADLY NASHVILLE SHOOTING

Last year, a fatal shooting at The Covenant School, a private Christian elementary school in Nashville, left three children and three adults dead.
The state Senate’s approval of the bill sparked outcries from teachers, students, Democratic lawmakers and even Covenant School parents.
On Tuesday, protesters screamed, ""Blood on your hands,"" before House speaker Cameron Sexton called for state troopers to remove them from the balcony, FOX 17 in Nashville reported.
NASHVILLE SCHOOL SHOOTER MANIFESTO: POLICE GROUP SIDES WITH SCHOOL IN LAWSUIT OVER RELEASE

Rep. Justin Jones, D-Nashville, called the bill ""morally insane.""
""Republicans continue to hold our state hostage,"" he reportedly said. ""God have mercy on you that you do not hear the pain of these mothers saying to protect kids, not guns.""
One of the sponsors of the bill, Sen. Paul Bailey, said the bill allows staff and faculty to carry arms if they choose to, but in order to carry a gun, they must go through 40 hours of training and undergo a psychological evaluation.
Rep. Ryan Williams, another sponsor of the bill, said the standards teachers must meet in order to carry in a Tennessee school will be ""very high.""
The law is considered ""100% permissive,"" according to Williams, and is up to school districts to implement. Approval also falls on law enforcement and school administrators.

Williams also said the bill is intended to be a deterrent, adding the identities of teachers carrying guns would not be released.
Still, Rep. Jason Powell, a Democrat from Nashville, said the law ""makes me sick to my stomach,"" adding it is dangerous.
""It’s going to have dangerous impacts around the world,"" Powell reportedly said. ""Think about law enforcement. It’s going to delay responses. It’s going to put law enforcement in danger. How will they know who’s the assailant and who’s the teacher with the gun?""

Lee did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment on the matter.
Before its passage, the bill’s proponents argued teachers and faculty could serve as a more immediate response force to a shooting situation. They said it could be particularly helpful in rural counties with limited law enforcement resources.
The contentious bill comes approximately a year after a deadly shooting last March at The Covenant School. The shooter, who was killed at the scene by police, killed three children and three adults during the rampage.
The bill also comes amid a larger push from Tennessee Republicans to loosen gun laws, including signing off on permitless carry for handguns in 2021.
The push includes an effort to expand the state’s permitless carry law to include long guns.

The original law allowed residents 21 and older to carry handguns in public without a permit. Two years later, Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti then allowed 18- to 20-year-olds to carry handguns publicly.
Lawmakers also approved a bill that would allow private schools with pre-kindergarten classes to have guns on campus. The governor has not yet signed it into law.

AI can predict political orientations from blank faces – and researchers fear 'serious' privacy challenges,"Rep. Jay Obernolte was selected to lead the House task force on AI. Fox News Digital speaks with the California Republican about his goals for the panel and his own thoughts about the rapidly advancing technology.
Researchers are warning that facial recognition technologies are ""more threatening than previously thought"" and pose ""serious challenges to privacy"" after a study found that artificial intelligence can be successful in predicting a person’s political orientation based on images of expressionless faces.
A recent study published in the journal American Psychologist says an algorithm’s ability to accurately guess one’s political views is ""on par with how well job interviews predict job success, or alcohol drives aggressiveness."" Lead author Michal Kosinski told Fox News Digital that 591 participants filled out a political orientation questionnaire before the AI captured what he described as a numerical ""fingerprint"" of their faces and compared them to a database of their responses to predict their views.
""I think that people don’t realize how much they expose by simply putting a picture out there,"" said Kosinski, an associate professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business.
""We know that people’s sexual orientation, political orientation, religious views should be protected. It used to be different. In the past, you could enter anybody’s Facebook account and see, for example, their political views, the likes, the pages they follow. But many years ago, Facebook closed this because it was clear for policymakers and Facebook and journalists that it is just not acceptable. It’s too dangerous,"" he continued.
GOOGLE CONSOLIDATES AI-FOCUSED DEEPMIND, RESEARCH TEAMS
The study used AI to predict people's political orientation based on images of expressionless faces.
""But you can still go to Facebook and see anybody’s picture. This person never met you, they never allowed you to look at a picture, they would never share their political orientation ... and yet, Facebook shows you their picture, and what our study shows is that this is essentially to some extent the equivalent to just telling you what their political orientation is,"" Kosinski added.
For the study, the authors said the images of the participants were collected in a highly controlled manner.
""Participants wore a black T-shirt adjusted using binder clips to cover their clothes. They removed all jewelry and – if necessary – shaved facial hair. Face wipes were used to remove cosmetics until no residues were detected on a fresh wipe. Their hair was pulled back using hair ties, hair pins, and a headband while taking care to avoid flyaway hairs,"" they wrote.
The facial recognition algorithm VGGFace2 then examined the images to determine ""face descriptors, or a numerical vector that is both unique to that individual and consistent across their different images,"" it said.

""Descriptors extracted from a given image are compared to those stored in a database. If they are similar enough, the faces are considered a match. Here, we use a linear regression to map face descriptors on a political orientation scale and then use this mapping to predict political orientation for a previously unseen face,"" the study also said.
The authors wrote that their findings ""underscore the urgency for scholars, the public, and policymakers to recognize and address the potential risks of facial recognition technology to personal privacy"" and that an ""analysis of facial features associated with political orientation revealed that conservatives tended to have larger lower faces.""
""Perhaps most crucially, our findings suggest that widespread biometric surveillance technologies are more threatening than previously thought,"" the study warned. ""Previous research showed that naturalistic facial images convey information about political orientation and other intimate traits.  But it was unclear whether the predictions were enabled by self-presentation, stable facial features, or both. Our results, suggesting that stable facial features convey a substantial amount of the signal, imply that individuals have less control over their privacy.""
Kosinski told Fox News Digital that ""algorithms can be very easily applied to millions of people very quickly and cheaply"" and that the study is ""more of a warning tale"" about the technology ""that is in your phone and is very widely used everywhere.""

The authors concluded that ""even crude estimates of people’s character traits can significantly improve the efficiency of online mass persuasion campaigns"" and that ""scholars, the public, and policymakers should take notice and consider tightening policies regulating the recording and processing of facial images.""

SCOTUS to take up challenge to Biden admin's ghost gun rule that group deems ‘abusive’,"Senate Intelligence Committee member Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tells ‘Hannity’ the idea of citizenship is in danger.
The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will hear a challenge to the Biden administration's regulation on so-called ""ghost guns"" next term.
The rule in question was issued in 2022 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to regulate ""buy build shoot"" kits that are available online or in stores that allow any individual to assemble a working firearm without a background check or the usual serial numbers required by the federal government.
The Fifth Circuit late last year struck down the rule, but the Justice Department appealed to the Supreme Court. The DOJ argued that the Gun Control Act of 1968 permits the rule because it defines a ""firearm"" to include ""any weapon…which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive,"" as well as ""the frame or receiver of any such weapon.""
However, gun rights groups say that the rule is ""unconstitutional and abusive.""
SUPREME COURT ALLOWS CONTINUED REGULATION OF SO-CALLED 'GHOST GUNS'

Firearms Policy Coalition President Brandon Combs, who is challenging the rule in court, said the group is ""delighted that the Supreme Court will hear our case and decide this important issue once and for all.""
""The Fifth Circuit’s decision in our case was correct and now that victory can be applied to the entire country,"" he said.
The ATF's rule requires unfinished parts of a firearm, like the frame of a handgun or the receiver of a long gun, to be treated like a completed firearm. These parts need to be licensed and must have serial numbers.
The rule also requires manufacturers to run background checks before selling these parts, as they are required to do for whole commercial firearms. The Biden administration argued the rule is necessary to respond to rising numbers of untraceable guns.
GUN GROUPS SLAM BIDEN ADMIN OVER NEW ATF RULE: 'WEAPONIZING EVERY TOOL'

The Justice Department had argued in court that local law enforcement agencies seized more than 19,000 ghost guns at crime scenes in 2021, a more than tenfold increase in just five years.
The Supreme Court had previously allowed the regulation to remain in effect while the lawsuit continued through the courts, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett voting with the three liberal members of the court to form the majority.

Hospital begs for snakebite victims to stop bringing in serpents when seeking help: 'Puts the staff at risk',"Five tammar wallaby joeys were seen hanging out in their new habitat at the Perth Zoo in Australia. Originally orphaned and found on Garden Island, the group is now being carefully watched by zoo staff. See them thrive!
An Australian hospital urged snakebite victims to stop trying to catch the slithery culprits when seeking medical attention after one patient came in carrying a serpent in a loosely locked box.
""We honestly don't want people interacting with snakes any more than they already have,"" Dr. Adam Michael, director of emergency medicine at Bundaberg Hospital near Brisbane, told the Australian Broadcast Company. ""Any attempts to either get close to a snake to catch or to kill, or to photograph the snake, just puts people at risk.""
About 3,000 people suffer suspected snakebites each year in Australia, according to the National Institutes of Health. Only between 100 and 200 cases end up requiring anti-venom.

He also cited examples of patients bringing in snakes contained in plastic bags and even less-secured plastic containers. The hospital then had to pay for the snakes to be relocated to the wild.

""We want people to be able to get seen and assessed quickly and having a live snake in the department slows up that process,"" Michael said, assuring that doctors do not need to see and identify the snake in order to treat poisonous bites.

""We can determine if you need anti-venom and if so, what anti-venom you need based on clinical signs, blood tests and also the snake venom detection kits that we keep here at the hospital,"" Michael stressed. ""We're actually not trained to identify snakes, and so it's not helpful. It just puts the staff at risk as well as yourself.""

Instead, Michael asked patients to focus on their wound and receiving treatment: Stay calm, avoid cleaning the affected area and apply firm pressure while seeking medical attention as soon as possible, according to The Guardian.

The Wide Bay Hospital & Health Service, which oversees operations of the Bundaberg Hospital, posted further guidelines on Facebook: Avoid washing the area, firmly bandage it, immobilize the limb to slow the spread of venom, mark the bandage to show where the bite is and continue to hold pressure – tight enough to slow the spread but not enough to cut off circulation.

""Applying a tourniquet, cutting the wound, sucking the venom or bringing the snake with you to emergency are not recommended,"" the post warned. ""We understand that being bitten by a snake is scary, but all facilities across our health service hold stocks of polyvalent and are well-prepared to treat snake bites.""

"North Korea issues nuclear 'warning signal' to US, South Korea","Korth Korean leader Kim Jong Un views a simulated nuclear counter attack drill. (Credit: Associated Press)
North Korea’s missile test on Monday was in fact a drill to test nuclear force preparedness, according to local media.
The incident raised alarms around the region after several short-range ballistic missiles were launched near Pyongyang and flew approximately 185 miles before falling in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
The drill’s main purpose, however, was to ""demonstrate the reliability, superiority, might and diverse means"" of the country’s nuclear forces and the Haekbangashoe system that serves as ""a clear warning signal to the enemies"" of North Korea, according to the Pyongyang Times.
The Haekbangashoe system, which means ""nuclear trigger,"" included the maneuver of troops into a ""counterattack posture"" that aimed at ""substantially strengthening the prompt counterattack capacity of the state nuclear force.""

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reportedly oversaw the drill, which occurred as the U.S. and South Korea started a combined joint formation drill at Kunsan Air Base, which commenced on April 12 and is expected to end April 26. He reportedly likened the weapon system to ""the firing of a sniper’s rifle.""
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff claimed that any reports of such accuracy or capabilities of its weapons system were likely exaggerated, and that South Korea’s military could detect and intercept any weapons.

To combat North Korea’s aggressive pursuit of nuclear preparedness, Washington, Tokyo and Seoul agreed to a system of real-time missile data-sharing, which would allow the three countries to monitor Pyongyang’s launches, according to Newsweek.
U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said the launch ""does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory, or to our allies,"" stressing instead the ""destabilizing impact of the DPRK’s illicit weapons program.""

"North Korea tests missile arsenal, has date circled on calendar for more possible provocations, experts say","Fox News correspondent Stephanie Bennett joins 'Fox News Live' to break down recent evidence tying missile fragments in Russian attacks to North Korea.
North Korea launched suspected short-range ballistic missiles into the sea on Monday, South Korean officials said.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the weapons were launched near Pyongyang and flew approximately 185 miles before falling in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. The launches came amid speculation that North Korea could soon launch a banned satellite into orbit, potentially on the April 25 founding anniversary of what became the North’s military.
The ranges of Monday’s missiles suggest the weapons could likely target sites in South Korea, prompting stern words from Seoul. There were no immediate reports of damage.
The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff strongly condemned the launches, saying they were a ""clear provocation"" that threatens peace on the Korean Peninsula. The office said it maintains readiness to ""overwhelmingly"" retaliate against North Korean provocations.

North Korea ran simulated nuclear counterstrikes against unspecified foreign enemies on Monday, according to state media.
The rocket launches were conducted under the supervision of supreme leader Kim Jong Un at an undisclosed location within the small region surrounding the capital city of Pyongyang.
Missiles fired Monday traveled over 300 kilometers and successfully struck a targeted island in the Sea of Japan.

The nuclear counterstrike simulation marked the debut of ""Haekbangashoe"" — the hermit kingdom's ""nuclear trigger"" — and proved the efficacy of the ""system of command, management, control and operation of the whole nuclear force,"" according to state news.
North Korea has claimed the 600mm multiple rocket launchers used in the Monday operation are capable of firing nuclear warheads.
Last week, North Korea conducted a separate series of military exercises over the Yellow Sea, testing a ""super-large warhead"" for cruise missiles and anti-aircraft missiles.

There cannot be a unilateral move at the UN to establish a Palestinian terror state,"The Israeli ambassador to the United Nations took a firm stance against the surge in antisemitism, insisting the ""time for words has passed"" and that we must take action now to ""ensure that no Jew lives in fear.""
Since Hamas' horrific attack on October 7th, in which over 1,200 Israelis were killed, 250 were captured and taken as hostages to Gaza, and thousands wounded, I am in the United Nations Security Council on a near weekly, sometimes daily, basis. Yet not one of these meetings has been dedicated to advancing the release of our hostages held in captivity in Gaza, nor to condemning Hamas for its heinous actions. These meetings are dedicated solely to slandering Israel in its defensive war against Hamas terrorists who have sworn to repeat October 7th again and again until Israel is destroyed.
This is a war for the state of Israel's future. Yet, in this distorted world of the U.N. where forward is backward and up is down, the Security Council sought to reward terrorism by unilaterally granting the Palestinians full membership after they committed the most widespread massacre of Jews since the Holocaust.
It is appalling, especially considering the requirements for admission to the U.N.: permanent population, defined territory, government, and capacity to enter relations with other states.
FULL UN MEMBERSHIP WON'T HELP PALESTINIANS WITH STATEHOOD, US AMBASSADOR SAYS
The Palestinian Authority has absolutely no control over Gaza. Everyone knows it. But even in Judea and Samaria, entire neighborhoods and cities are ruled by other terrorist gangs, and the Palestinian ""Authority,"" ironically, has no authority. Who exactly was the Council voting to ""recognize"" and give full membership status to?
But, above anything else, a very important principle stated in Article 4 of the U.N. Charter is, ""Membership in the United Nations is open to all peace-loving states.""
If the U.N. can’t prevent wars or defend human rights, it has lost any reason to exist.
Does anyone doubt that the Palestinians fail to meet these criteria? Did anyone hear any Palestinian leader even condemn the massacre of Israeli children?
In every poll, even those conducted by the Palestinians, the vast majority of Palestinians support Hamas and continued terror against Israelis.
THE SECURITY COUNCIL REVIVES THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY’S UN HOPES. THE US SAYS NOT YET
The Palestinian Authority is the opposite of a ""peace-loving"" entity.
The Palestinian Authority not only have not condemned the October 7th Massacre, they are also paying monthly salaries to all the terrorists that took part in it, rewarding the rapists.
This is a genocide-loving entity that does not deserve any status at the U.N.
But sadly, for the Security Council, the Palestinians' inability to meet the criteria simply does not matter. The U.N. Charter is important to them only when it can be used against Israel. In other words, the U.N. Charter be damned. International law be damned.
What this Council has decided to focus on is granting a prize to terrorists. Granting the perpetrators and supporters of October 7th full membership status in the U.N. is the vilest reward for the vilest crimes.
The only thing that a forced, unilateral recognition of a Palestinian State would do is to make any future negotiations almost impossible. As long as the Palestinians feel that they can exploit this politicized body to their benefit, why would they bother at the negotiating table or support any compromise?
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY FORMS NEW CABINET FOLLOWING WORLDWIDE CALLS FOR GOVERNMENT REFORM
The Palestinians have rejected every peace plan ever made and they continue to support terror and boycott negotiations. And now they know that their rejectionism pays off.
They can say no, no, no, but still get what they demand, because the U.N. is guided by politics, not morality or truth.
All the Security Council is ""accomplishing"" through this destructive approach, is making a solution to the conflict unattainable.
The U.N. is no longer about multilateralism, sadly. It is now committed to multi-terrorism.

And if the U.N. can’t prevent wars or defend human rights, it has lost any reason to exist.
The day will come when it will be shuttered. The U.N., as we know it, will cease to exist and in its place will stand a body that truly cares about human rights. That truly fights to promote peace. That is capable of putting politics aside, for the sake of justice, morality, and humanity. And when that day comes – and it will – the meeting and subsequent vote to force the establishment of a Palesti-Nazi state will be remembered as catalysts of the UN’s collapse.
A meeting where the world burned, but all that concerned the Security Council was helping terrorists in Gaza survive.

A meeting where a terror entity could be given full membership status. This is how far the UN has fallen. And this is why the UN – in its current format – has no future.

Morning Glory: Joe Biden's antisemitism problem,"Sahar Tartak, who was injured by an anti-Israel protester, joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the harrowing incident as pro-Hamas sentiment gains ground on various college campuses.
President Joe Biden has an antisemitism problem. It is large and growing larger. It is his problem and he can’t shed responsibility for it.In a nutshell: The people who work for him are not doing their jobs to stop discrimination against Jews in America. Anyone with eyes and ears can see and hear what has been happening in America for six months, and a climax of sorts was reached this weekend at Columbia and Yale Universities. Police have taken some action against the violent protesters at the New Haven and Upper West Side campuses of the two schools, but how did it reach this point? Why have the Biden Departments of Education and Justice been MIA? The problem manifests immediately on the landing page of the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights where any visitor finds this notice right off the bat: ""The majority of OCR staff are working remotely because of the pandemic.""
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS: 5 DRAMATIC MOMENTS FROM A WEEK OF CHAOS
Huh? The pandemic is long gone everywhere except the DOE. Everyone in the federal government should be at their desk and answering their phones or at least making it through a few emails a day. That would not be enough though. There should be task forces of DOE and DOJ personnel dispatched to every campus where these outages are occurring. Take the pictures. Make the first-hand reports. Become witnesses, not desk jockeys.
Even folks ""working remotely"" from the vast Department building at 400 Maryland Avenue SW in D.C. ought to be able to do the easy stuff of answering emails. The portion of the website titled ""Race, Color, or National Origin Discrimination"" includes what should be known to every DOE-OCR employee: ""Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance.""There is an online form for filing a complaint about unlawful discrimination  —but it hardly seems necessary when every news organization and social media platform has produced coverage of the antisemitic harassment at Columbia and Yale and before that at Harvard, the University of Michigan etc.
JEWISH, PRO-ISRAEL COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR SAYS HE WAS BLOCKED FROM ENTERING MAIN CAMPUS: 'THIS IS 1938'
Nevertheless, the organization ""Campus Reform"" has stepped up to wake up DOE-OCR by filing complaint after complaint about the rolling waves of anti-Semitism on American campuses.Campus Reform bills itself as ""America’s leading site for college news.""  It also brands itself as a ""conservative watchdog to the nation’s higher education system,"" one which ""exposes liberal bias and abuse on the nation’s college campuses."" Maybe that’s why the Biden administration seems to be ignoring its emails: Complaints from conservatives don’t count.
""Our team of professional journalists works alongside student activists and student journalists to report on the conduct and misconduct of campus administrators, faculty, and students,"" the organization adds. ""Campus Reform holds itself to rigorous journalism standards and strives to present each story with accuracy, objectivity, and public accountability.""
ANTISEMITISM ON CAMPUS SURGES AS AGITATORS TAKE OVER
Good for them and they have indeed been relentless in cataloging many of the antisemitic incidents and filing the complaints required by the Department of Education. To what end?

Marshall and his team have filed scores of complaints against the highest profile offenders like Princeton. But nothing has happened. No funds have been cut off; no civil rights actions filed in federal court by DOE-OCR in conjunction with the Division of Civil Rights at the Department of Justice. Why not? It’s certainly not for ""lack of notice.""  The answer has to be in either the incompetence or the ideology of the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Education, or both. The StandWithUs Center for Legal Justice has brought a private suit against MIT for the antisemitism there, but DOJ has not joined it. Finding any DOJ suit against any college or university for antisemitic acts since Oct. 7 is impossible. They aren’t in that business. Like the DOE-OCR, the feds at Justice have taken a vacation from enforcing civil rights laws when Jews are the victims.
In sharp contrast, the State Department appears set to sanction units in the Israeli Defense Forces that somebody at State believes are committing war crimes of some sort. Astonishing but true: Team Biden can find defendants to accuse of bad acts inside of Israel but can’t muster any response to our civil rights meltdown in the U.S.
At what point do American supporters of Israel and especially American Jews realize that the Democrat Party has reverted to the policies of the State Department throughout 1940 to 1944 —the era of Breckinridge Long? Don’t recognize the name? Read this.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPToo harsh to compare the bureaucrats of today with Long? Maybe it would have been in October or even early November. But there has been six months of growing antisemitism in the U.S. generally and creeping anti-Israel policies inside the Biden administration specifically. It will be up to voters to punish this disgusting abdication of enforcement of the country’s civil rights laws coupled with a turn against our ally Israel.
Let’s hope no student has to be killed before DOE and DOJ acts.

Democrats want to mine Trump's legal battles for a 2024 win but they didn't count on one big thing,"Trump attorney Will Scharf tells ‘The Story’ that elections shouldn’t play out in courtrooms, but at ballot boxes.
Can Donald Trump beat Joe Biden in November despite being cooped up in a courtroom, fenced in by what he calls an ongoing ""witch hunt""? It won’t be easy; the polls have tightened in recent weeks, perhaps because Biden is out campaigning, gleefully spewing taxpayer money to swing-state voters and slamming his opponent, and Trump is not.
Instead, Trump is on trial, again, in New York City.
His enemies in the liberal press are jubilant. Not because Trump has committed some heinous crime and will be brought to justice. Not because convicting the former president would make the lives of New Yorkers, or all Americans, better in any way. No, leftwing media types are exultant because they want to see The Donald disgraced, weakened and brought to his knees.
TRUMP TRIAL: FORMER PRESIDENT 'INNOCENT,' SAYS DEFENSE AS DA ALLEGES 'CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY'
For proof, look no further than Maggie Haberman’s recent front-page piece in the New York Times. The Times writer is almost giddy.
Haberman, a long-time Trump antagonist, recounts the scene in the ""decrepit"" courtroom of Democrat donor Judge Juan Merchan, who is presiding over the hush money trial brought by Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg. Late in the day, the former president stands up, ready to go home, and is ordered by Merchan to ""have a seat."" Boom! Haberman is thrilled, noting that Trump ""is used to setting his own pace"" but suddenly, he is ""stripped of control.""
Haberman describes the real estate tycoon appearing ""haggard and rumpled"" by day’s end; ""The mundanity of the courtroom has all but swallowed Mr. Trump"" writes Maggie, dispelling his long-sought image of ""bigness.""
This is nectar to Trump opponents. After all, Gallup reports that only 38% of voters see President Biden as a ""strong and decisive leader"", compared to 57% who think Trump has those attributes. They hope Bragg’s show trial will eliminate that divide.
NY VS TRUMP: THE EVIDENCE PROSECUTORS CAN PRESENT IF FORMER PRESIDENT TESTIFIES
Haberman says Trump’s plan was to campaign in spite of the trial but notes that during the first week he only made one public appearance, visiting a bodega. (She fails to note he was greeted by throngs of Harlem residents shouting his name.) ""Some advisors"" she writes, ""are conscious of Mr. Trump appearing diminished""; she says they’re pushing for some larger rallies in the area. Those advisers also think, according to Haberman, that ""the process [of the trial] may damage him as much as a guilty verdict.""
Is she right? Or is Haberman herself hoping that a six-week trial will topple Trump’s election hopes?
Up until now, the numerous charges brought against Donald Trump have pumped up his support among people who feel he is being unfairly treated and who are disgusted by the ""lawfare"" loosed upon the former president. His approval ratings have not suffered and he has successfully fund-raised off the ""witch hunts."" Can he continue to make lemonade from lemons?
GOV GAVIN NEWSOM WORRIES ABOUT 'OVERINDULGENCE,' 'OBSESSION' WITH TRUMP HUSH MONEY TRIAL: 'LESS IS MORE'
Fair-minded Americans will continue to view the cases brought against Trump in New York as politically-motivated -- a continuation of the years-long effort to undermine and penalize the former president for upending liberal complacency and beating Hillary Clinton in 2016. Polling has shown the trials are unlikely to have much impact on the outcome of the election; opinions about his guilt and the reasonableness of the charges fall mainly along party lines.
But chances are, the next few weeks will be embarrassing for The Donald, as the case now being tried in Manhattan focuses on his relations with and payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels. Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg has taken charges of dishonest bookkeeping, normally a misdemeanor, and like Rumpelstiltskin, spun them magically into felony charges of election interference. When he first launched the case, which had been spurned by his predecessor, even the New York Times described it as ""creative."" Nonetheless, given the jury pool, it’s quite possible that Trump could be convicted in the Bragg case, given the Democrat-rich venue.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
Meanwhile, elsewhere in the Empire State, Attorney General Letitia James, who succeeded in convicting Trump on equally dubious charges of having inflated the value of his real estate holdings, is plenty angry that a panel of judges reduced the bond that he was required to post while appealing the case. The judge overseeing the trial had hit Trump with penalties totaling nearly $450 million, said to be the largest ever recorded, even though the former president’s purported wrong-doing resulted in no losses to any party.
Both James and Bragg campaigned on bringing down Trump, and they are trying their darndest to live up to that promise. Both have brought cases that outside of New York would likely be laughed out of court. But here we are, in Manhattan, a district where Republicans are as rare as unicorns, with Trump, the GOP nominee for president, stuck in a courtroom for six weeks.
Meanwhile, President Biden is out on the campaign trail taking every opportunity to trash talk his opponent. Biden, whose approval ratings confirm his standing as the worst president in modern times, and who demanded that his Attorney General Merrick Garland do everything possible to lock Trump up.
Most beneficial to Joe Biden is that in coming weeks the spotlight will be on a Manhattan courtroom instead of the calamity he has created at the southern border and the damage his reckless spending has caused our economy.

But President Biden in the spotlight is not all good news for Democrats; there was a reason that in 2020 they kept him cooped up in the basement. As Biden piles up gaffes and goofs in public appearances, Trump can critique the unrest on college campuses, Biden’s decision to surreptitiously lift sanctions on Iran, the absurd decision to block oil and gas development in the U.S. and so many other failures of the Biden administration.
Six weeks will fly by; Trump will be back and, my guess, he won’t have missed a beat.

Young girl survives cancer thanks to little sister’s lifesaving donation: 'A perfect match',"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A young girl in the U.K. is in cancer remission thanks to her sister’s lifesaving bone marrow donation.
Ruby Leaning, 10, was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia after collapsing on the school playground in Jan. 2020, according to SWNS, the British news service.
The rare blood cancer required an urgent bone marrow transplant to keep the 6-year-old alive.
AI COULD PREDICT WHETHER CANCER TREATMENTS WILL WORK, EXPERTS SAY
After several tests, Leaning’s then 2-year-old sister, Mabel Leaning, came up as a ""perfect match.""
The Leaning sisters' grandmother, Amanda Fawcett, confirmed to SWNS that Ruby Leaning received treatment with Mabel Leaning’s stem cells.

Ruby Leaning was declared cancer-free in 2022 — meaning Mabel Leaning ""saved Ruby’s life for sure,"" Fawcett said.
""She's a happy, normal and healthy 10-year-old who loves swimming, dancing and piano lessons.""
""We [weren’t] expecting her to be a match at first, but thankfully she was, so we just couldn't believe our luck,"" she said.
""It was amazing – we were so thankful.""

Alzheimer's drug embrace slows down as US doctors' reluctance grows,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Nine months into the U.S. launch of the first drug proven to slow the advance of Alzheimer's, Eisai and Biogen's Leqembi is facing an unexpected hurdle to widespread use: an entrenched belief among some doctors that treating the memory-robbing disease is futile.
Alzheimer's experts had anticipated bottlenecks due to Leqembi's requirements, which include additional diagnostic tests, twice-monthly infusions and regular brain scans to guard against potentially lethal side effects.
And those issues have played a role in slow adoption since the drug was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, according to interviews with 20 neurologists and geriatricians from rural, urban, academic and community practices in 19 states.
FDA FULLY APPROVES 'NOVEL' ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE DRUG LEQEMBI, WILL BE COVERED BY MEDICARE
In interviews with Reuters, seven doctors treating patients for Alzheimer's attributed their own reluctance to prescribe Leqembi to concerns about the drug's efficacy, cost and risks.
The use of the FDA-approved Alzheimer's drug, Leqembi, has slowed down as doctor's skepticism increases, while patients like Lyn Castellano in St. Louis continue to use the drug as it offers a sense of hope for her future. (Joe Castellano/Handout via REUTERS)
""I don't think it's a good Alzheimer's drug. I think that's the problem,"" said Dr. James Burke, a neurologist at the Ohio State University who has been an outspoken critic of Leqembi. ""It's certainly nothing like the home run that we're looking for.""
Another six scientists, all leaders in the field, said ""therapeutic nihilism"" – the belief that Alzheimer's is a hopelessly intractable disease – was playing a bigger role than anticipated in suppressing demand from primary care doctors, geriatricians and neurologists who could be sending patients to memory specialists for treatment.
Dr. Reisa Sperling, a neurologist and Alzheimer's researcher at Mass General Brigham in Boston, likens some doctors' skepticism to Leqembi to fatalistic attitudes about cancer treatment 30 years ago: ""You can't really do anything about it, so why would you even want to get tested?""
Alex Scott, Eisai's chief administrative officer, acknowledged that skepticism has weighed on the launch along with slower-than-expected adoption by large health systems.
He suggested that some of the doctors' hesitancy could be a holdover from the decades-long journey to prove that removing the Alzheimer's protein beta amyloid from the brain could slow the course of the disease. Before Esai released the promising results of its Leqembi trial, some thought that area of research ""a fool's errand,"" Scott said.
""We are beginning to make more and more progress every single month. So we're still quite encouraged,"" Scott said. ""This is a new journey, and I think it takes some time for providers to figure it out.""
Leqembi was the first amyloid-targeting drug granted full FDA approval after it slowed the decline in cognition in people in the early stages of Alzheimer's by 27% in a clinical trial.
Of the 10,000 Americans the companies hoped to treat by the end of March, Eisai announced only a couple thousand had begun treatment as of the end of January. An Eisai spokeswoman declined to provide updated numbers.
Even for treatments that do not require dramatic changes to medical practice, adoption of new drugs is notoriously slow. Several studies have estimated that it can take 17 years on average for clinical research to be translated into routine practice.
The disease is estimated to affect more than 6 million Americans, according to the Alzheimer's Association.
NEW DEMENTIA DRUG 'HAS GIVEN ME HOPE’: ALZHEIMER’S PATIENTS REVEAL THEIR STORIES
Fewer than half of U.S. neurologists recommend Leqembi to patients, according to a January survey by life sciences market researcher Spherix Global Insights.
Dr. Michael Greicius, a professor at Stanford University's Center for Memory Disorders, said there is little evidence that Leqembi benefits patients in a meaningful way.
""If we take the trial result at face value, the differences between placebo and treatment are likely small enough as to be undetectable by patients and family members or physicians,"" said Greicius, who does not recommend Leqembi to patients.
He said the long wait for an Alzheimer's drug has put doctors in the position of feeling obligated to offer a treatment ""even if the evidence for it is very slim.""
Other doctors have raised concerns about the risk of brain swelling and bleeding associated with Leqembi as well as the costs associated with the $26,500 annual drug, frequent MRIs and twice-monthly infusions.
""There are significant risks associated with these drugs, there are significant costs, and I would say there is marginal benefit,"" said Dr. Eric Widera, a geriatrician and professor at University of California San Francisco, referring to amyloid-lowering treatments.
In an editorial published in November in the Journal of Gerontological Nursing, Donna Fick, president of the American Geriatrics Society, advised doctors that the group recommends caution in the use of lecanemab, which is sold under the brand name of Leqembi.
""It is not yet clear whether treatments such as lecanemab that remove amyloid from the brain produce clinically important slowing of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.""
Dr. Jonathan Liss, a neurologist from Columbus, Georgia, who serves on Eisai's scientific advisory board and has tested Leqembi in clinical trials, said he first warned about nihilism at a November 2022 conference following a presentation of Leqembi's breakthrough study.
Eisai had asked its scientific advisors how the drug might fare against future rivals. Liss cautioned that rivals were not the enemy; ""your enemy is nihilism,'"" he recalled. ""All of the neurologists around the table started applauding.""
FIRST DRUG PROVEN TO SLOW ALZHEIMER'S WON'T BE AVAILABLE TO MOST PATIENTS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS
Dr. Nathaniel Chin, a geriatrician with the University of Wisconsin's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, said he was the target of negative comments on social media after he urged geriatricians to embrace such treatments in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.
Geriatricians, geriatric social workers and nurses objected, arguing that the drug's statistically significant benefit was not clinically meaningful to patients, especially given the risks, he said.
""I would ask the question, 'Is it ethical to withhold a medication that is FDA-approved and covered by insurance from someone who knows the risk and is willing to take it?'"" Chin said.
Dr. Priya Singhal, executive vice president and head of development at Biogen, acknowledged some apathy among physicians about the treatment but said that infrastructure and lack of access to neurologists have been bigger issues.
Singhal said the companies are working with physician and patient advocacy groups and developing educational programs and materials aimed at diagnosing early-stage patients, managing side effects and understanding the drug's benefits.
The companies said they intend to increase their salesforce by 30% as they aim for 100,000 patients by 2026.
For the moment, Leqembi is the only Alzheimer's drug on the market designed to slow the course of the disease. A decision on Lilly's donanemab has been delayed until the FDA convenes an advisory panel.
Lilly neuroscience president Anne White said in an interview that she sees doctor hesitancy as an issue that the company hopes to address by making clear which patients benefit from such treatments.
In the early stages of Alzheimer's, many patients are still independent, and to be able to remain so for longer is very meaningful, she said.
Lyn Castellano, 64, who founded and ran a St. Louis breast cancer charity for 20 years and trained therapy dogs, started taking Leqembi last September, nearly a year after she found herself struggling with keeping track of appointments and was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment.
Castellano said the prospect of bleeding in the brain – a possible side effect of the drug - was her biggest concern, but her family believed the drug may offer a chance at slowing the disease.
She is one of more than 140 patients being treated by physicians from Washington University in St. Louis, and has had 13 infusions and two MRIs without incident.
Dr. Suzanne Schindler, an Alzheimer's researcher who is treating Castellano, said Leqembi ""forces clinicians to completely change the way they have practiced medicine for many years.""
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
She said she is candid about Leqembi's modest benefit as well as the risks. About 80% of those she believes are good candidates have opted for the treatment, she said.
While Castellano can't tell if Leqembi is helping, she says the treatment has given her hope, and she doesn't mind the twice monthly infusions.

Former rugby star Wally Lewis urges Australian government to fund CTE support services,"Rugby player Chris Robinson was playing a game when he used a tackle as an excuse to stay down — causing his girlfriend Amanda Tuckwell to rush onto the field and see what happened. He then got on one knee and proposed.
A legendary rugby player has cited the fear and anxiety that has come into his life among the reasons for urging the Australian government to fund support services and education about chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).
Wally Lewis, dubbed ""The King"" when he played rugby league for Queensland state and Australia in the 1980s, made an appeal on behalf of the Concussion and CTE Coalition for millions of dollars in funding during a National Press Club address Tuesday.
The 64-year-old Lewis said he’s living with probable CTE, which he described as a type of dementia associated with repeated concussive and sub-concussive blows to the head.
HYPE OR HORROR? THE RISK OF CTE BRAIN DISEASE DIVIDES FOOTBALL AND MEDICAL COMMUNITIES
Lewis, who worked for decades as a television sports anchor after retiring as a player in the early 1990s, relayed his own experience to get his message across.

""The fear is real. I don’t want anyone to have to live with the fear and anxiety that I live with every day, worried about what I’ve forgotten ... the fear of what my future will look like,"" Lewis said. ""And living with the constant fear and anxiety that I’ll let people down – the people who all my life have been able to rely on me and looked to me for my strength and leadership.""
Lewis led Australia’s Kangaroos in 24 international matches, was among the original players to popularize the annual State-of-Origin series, and was included in Australia’s Rugby League Team of the Century in 2008.
The National Rugby League has honored him as a so-called ""Immortal"" of the game.
O.J. SIMPSON'S BRAIN WILL NOT BE DONATED TO CTE RESEARCH: REPORT
Yet his memories of it aren’t clear. He started playing rugby league as a young boy and also played rugby union at an elite level before embarking on a professional career in rugby league.
""It’s a journey marked by the twin shadows of fear and embarrassment, a journey through the fog of dementia and the erosion of my memory,"" he said. ""I once had the confidence in myself to succeed, lead a team to victory, captain my country, remember the strengths and weaknesses of opposition teams, organize myself each and every day and feel well and truly in control of my life.
""Now, much of that confidence has been taken away from me by the effects of probable CTE dementia.""
Lewis said better community awareness on concussion was needed and prevention programs, including a sharper focus on tackling techniques from young players through to professionals.

Awareness of CTE and concussion has grown since players in contact football sports, including the National Football League in the United States and rugby union in Britain, launched concussion lawsuits.
The Rugby World Cup took place last year against the backdrop of a concussion lawsuit in Britain that had similarities to one settled by the NFL in 2013 at a likely cost of more than $1 billion.
CTE, a degenerative brain disease known to cause violent moods, depression, dementia and other cognitive difficulties, can only be diagnosed posthumously. It has been linked to repeated hits to the head endured by football, rugby and hockey players, boxers and members of the military.
""As Wally Lewis I have influence – I have a platform – and I intend to use it at every opportunity to bring about change for all Australians like me who are impacted by CTE,"" Lewis said, ""and to do whatever I can to protect the brains of Australian children from CTE.""",Stay up-to-date on the biggest health and wellness news with our weekly recap.,https://www.foxnews.com/health/former-rugby-star-wally-lewis-urges-australian-government-fund-cte-support-services,F
"AI could predict whether cancer treatments will work, experts say: ‘Exciting time in medicine'","Doctors believe Artificial Intelligence is now saving lives, after a major advancement in breast cancer screenings. A.I. is detecting early signs of the disease, in some cases years before doctors would find the cancer on a traditional scan.
A chemotherapy alternative called immunotherapy is showing promise in treating cancer — and a new artificial intelligence tool could help ensure that patients have the best possible experience.
Immunotherapy, first approved in 2011, uses the cancer patient’s own immune system to target and fight cancer.
While it doesn’t work for everyone, for the 15% to 20% who do see results, it can be life-saving.
WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?
Like any medication, immunotherapy has the potential for adverse side effects — which can be severe for some.
Studies show that some 10% to 15% of patients develop ""significant toxicities.""
A chemotherapy alternative called immunotherapy is showing promise in treating cancer — and a new artificial intelligence tool could help ensure that patients have the best possible experience. (iStock)
Headquartered in Chicago, GE HealthCare — working in tandem with Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) in Nashville, Tennessee — has created an AI model that's designed to help remove some of the uncertainties surrounding immunotherapy.
Over the five years it’s been in development, the AI model was trained on thousands of patients’ electronic health records (EHRs) to recognize patterns in how they responded to immunotherapy, focusing on safety and effectiveness.
AI MODEL COULD HELP PREDICT LUNG CANCER RISKS IN NON-SMOKERS, STUDY FINDS: ‘SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENT’
""The model predicts which patients are likely to derive the benefit from immunotherapy versus those patients who may not,"" said Jan Wolber, global digital product leader at GE HealthCare’s pharmaceutical diagnostics segment, in an interview with Fox News Digital.
""It also predicts which patients have a likelihood of developing one or more significant toxicities.""
When pulling data from the patient’s health record, the model looks at demographic information, imaging scans, preexisting diagnoses, lifestyle habits (such as smoking), medication history and more.
Immunotherapy, which was first approved in 2011, uses the cancer patient’s immune system to target and fight cancer.  (iStock)
""All of these data are already being collected by the patient’s oncologist, or they’re filling out a form in the waiting room ahead of time,"" said Travis Osterman, a medical oncologist and associate chief medical information officer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, in an interview with Fox News Digital.
(Osterman is working with Wolber on the development of the AI model.)
BREAST CANCER BREAKTHROUGH: AI PREDICTS A THIRD OF CASES PRIOR TO DIAGNOSIS IN MAMMOGRAPHY STUDY
""We're not asking for additional blood samples or complex imaging. These are all data points that we're already collecting — vital signs, diagnoses, lab values, those sorts of things.""
In a study, the AI model showed 70% to 80% accuracy in predicting patients’ responses to immunotherapies, according to an article published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology Clinical Cancer Informatics.
""While the models are not perfect, this is actually a very good result,"" Wolber said. ""We can implement those models with very little additional effort because there are no additional measurements required in the clinic.""
This type of technology is ""a natural progression of what we've been doing in medicine for a very long time,"" Osterman said.
""The only difference is, instead of surveying patients, we're taking the entirety of the medical record and looking for risk factors that contribute to an outcome,"" he said in an interview with Fox News Digital.
The AI model was trained on thousands of patients’ electronic health records to recognize patterns in how they responded to immunotherapy, focusing on safety and effectiveness. (iStock)
With immunotherapy, there is generally a lower response rate than with chemotherapy, Osterman noted — but some patients have ""incredible responses"" and ultimately become cancer-free.
""I would be horrified to know that one of my patients that I didn't give immunotherapy to could have been one of the tremendous responders,"" he told Fox News Digital.
Conversely, Osterman noted that in rare cases, immunotherapy can have some serious side effects.
""I would be horrified to know that one of my patients that I didn't give immunotherapy to could have been one of the tremendous responders.""
""I would say about half of patients don't have any side effects, but for those who do, some of them are really life-altering,"" he said.
""We don't want to miss anyone, but we also don't want to harm anyone.""
At the core of the AI project, Osterman said, is the ability to ""put all the information into the exam room,"" so the oncologist can counsel the patient about the risks and benefits of this particular therapy and make the best, most informed decision about their care.
Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, was not involved in the AI model’s development but commented on its potential.
""AI models are emerging that are helping to manage responses to cancer treatments,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""These can allow for more treatment options and be more predictive of outcome.""
AI models like this one are an example of ""the essential future of personalized medicine,"" Siegel said, ""where each patient is approached differently and their cancer is analyzed and treated with precision using genetic and protein analysis.""
As long as physicians and scientists remain in charge — ""not a computer or robot"" — Siegel said that ""there is no downside.""
The AI model does carry some degree of limitations, the experts acknowledged.
""The models obviously do not return 100% accuracy,"" Wolber told Fox News Digital. ""So there are some so-called false positives or false negatives.""
NEW AI ‘CANCER CHATBOT’ PROVIDES PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WITH 24/7 SUPPORT: 'EMPATHETIC APPROACH'
The tool is not a ""black box"" that will provide a surefire answer, he noted. Rather, it's a tool that provides data points to the clinician and informs them as they make patient management decisions.
Osterman pointed out that the AI model uses a ""relatively small dataset.""
""We would love to be able to refine our predictions by learning on bigger data sets,"" he said.

The team is currently looking for partnerships that will enable them to test the AI model in new settings and achieve even higher accuracy in its predictions.
Another challenge, Osterman said, is the need to integrate these AI recommendations into the workflow.
""This is pretty new for us as a health care community, and I think we're all going to be wrestling with that question,"" he said.

Looking ahead, once the AI model has achieved the necessary regulatory approvals, GE HealthCare plans to make the technology available for widespread use by clinicians — perhaps even expanding to other care areas, such as neurology or cardiology.
There is also the potential to incorporate it into drug development.
""We don't want to miss anyone, but we also don't want to harm anyone.""
""One of the things that drug makers struggle with is that some of the agents that may be really useful for some patients could be really toxic for others,"" Osterman said.

J6 rioter who struck officer with pole sentenced to 6 years in prison,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A man who became a fugitive after a federal jury convicted him of assaulting police officers during the U.S. Capitol riot was sentenced on Tuesday to six years in prison.
David Joseph Gietzen, 31, of Sanford, North Carolina, struck a police officer with a pole during a mob's Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.
JAN. 6 WAS NOT AN INSURRECTION, SAYS TURLEY, WARNS DEMOCRATS OF 'SLIPPERY SLOPE' THREATENING DEMOCRACY
Gietzen told U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols that he didn't intend to hurt anybody that day. But he didn't express any regret or remorse for his actions on Jan. 6, when he joined a mob of Donald Trump supporters in interrupting the joint session of Congress for certifying President Joe Biden's 2020 electoral victory.
""I have to make it explicitly known that I believe I did the right thing,"" he said before learning his sentence.
The judge said Gietzen made it clear during his trial testimony — and his sentencing hearing — that he clings to his baseless beliefs that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump.
""Mr. Gietzen essentially was unapologetic today about his conduct,"" Nichols said.

Last August, a jury convicted Gietzen of eight counts, including assault and civil disorder charges. After his trial conviction, Gietzen disregarded a court order to report to prison on Oct. 20, 2023, while awaiting sentencing. He missed several hearings for his case before he was arrested at his mother’s home in North Carolina on Dec. 12, 2023.
""This pattern of flouting rules and laws and doing what he wants, regardless of the consequences, is how Gietzen operates,"" prosecutors wrote in a court filing.
Defense attorney Ira Knight said Gietzen apparently remained at his house, ""just waiting to be picked up,"" and wasn't on the run from authorities or trying to hide after his conviction.
Prosecutors recommended a prison term of 10 years and one month for Gietzen, who worked as a computer programming engineer after graduating from North Carolina State University in 2017 with bachelor's degrees in computer engineering and electrical engineering.
""Clearly, Gietzen is bright and able to get something done when he puts his mind to it – be it a college degree or assaulting officers as part of in a violent mob,"" prosecutors wrote.
Gietzen's attorneys requested a four-year prison sentence.
""David’s current philosophy is that he no longer wishes to be engaged with the political process,"" defense attorneys wrote. ""His involvement with politics has concluded and should be an indication to the Court that he is no longer interested in being a threat to the public or political process.""
Gietzen traveled to Washington, D.C., with his brother from their home in North Carolina. He attended then-President Donald Trump's ""Stop the Steal"" rally near the White House on Jan. 6 before marching to the Capitol.
As the mob of Trump supporters overwhelmed a police line on the Capitol's West Plaza, Gietzen shoved a police officer, grabbed another officer's gas mask and struck an officer with a pole.
""And all of Gietzen’s violence was based on a lack of respect for law enforcement and the democratic process — its goal was to get himself and other rioters closer to the building so they could interfere with the certification of the election,"" prosecutors wrote.

Gietzen later bragged about participating in the riot in messages to friends and relatives, saying he had ""never been prouder to be an American.""

"Oklahoma father 'hunted' his own family, left one child, 10, alive: 'Nothing short of a massacre'","The police made a statement about the gruesome discovery. CREDIT: Okalhoma Police Department
This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).
A 10-year-old child woke up after his father ""hunted"" down his older brothers and mom in a disturbing murder-suicide inside a suburban Oklahoma home, police said.
Jonathon Candy, 42, had an argument with his wife, Lindsay, which spiraled out of control. He grabbed a gun and fatally shot his wife ""multiple times"" and ""systematically went through the home shooting the children,"" Oklahoma City Police Sgt. Gary Knight said.
Responding officers found the 10-year-old outside alive, but his brothers — Dylan, 18, Ethan, 14, and Lucas, 12 — were all killed before Jonathan turned the gun on himself, according to police.
""Make no mistake. What happened in that residence was nothing short of a massacre,"" Knight said during a Tuesday press conference. ""The children were hunted down and killed.""

Unfathomable confusion shrouded the murders for hours after responding officers found the dead family Monday morning and a 10-year-old boy outside the house.
Knight described the scene inside the Yukon, Oklahoma, home as ""carnage.""
""It remains a mystery as to what caused Mr. Candy to murder his wife and three of his children,"" according to police, which said there were no previous domestic incidents at the Yukon, Oklahoma home, a suburb of Oklahoma City.

Los Angeles authorities arrest suspect in shooting of deputy at traffic light,"A Los Angeles County deputy riding a marked motorcycle was shot in the back in West Covina. The suspected gunman remains on the run, FOX 11 Los Angeles reports.
The person who allegedly shot a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department motorcycle deputy in the back while he was stopped at a red light has been arrested, Los Angeles police say.
Raymundo Duran, 47, was arrested in San Diego County, according to officials. He was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving and possession of illegal weapons.
At a press conference on Tuesday, Sheriff Robert Luna said that Duran is a gang member with an extensive rap sheet.
""He has a very extensive criminal history, a very violent criminal history,"" Luna said.

""At the end of the day, this man was armed with a firearm. He had no business having a firearm in his possession with his criminal history,"" he added.
The shooting happened just before 3 p.m. Monday near Interstate 10 at the intersection of North Barranca Street and East Garvey Avenue, according to FOX 11 Los Angeles.
LA County Sheriff Robert Luna credits a bulletproof vest Deputy Samuel Aispuro, 43, was wearing at the time of the shooting for saving his life.
Aispuro was in uniform and was riding a department-issued motorcycle at the time of the shooting. He was taken by ambulance to a medical center for treatment and, according to Luna, the vest that he was wearing saved his life.
Authorities immediately began searching for a white sedan with tinted windows, last seen heading west on Interstate 10 from Barranca Street. They eventually found Duran and arrested him.

During the press conference, Luna took a moment to thank the witnesses who helped officials with their investigation.
""The witnesses that came forward immediately when our deputy was shot in the back, I can't say enough about them,"" Luna said. ""They saw what they saw, got out of their cars, went immediately to aid our deputy…and eventually their information became very important to the investigation that our homicide detectives are conducting.""

4 Iranians indicted for alleged malicious multi-year cyber campaign targeting US government and defense firms,"Iranian-American lawyer Elica Le Bon on the ongoing anti-Israel protests and how violent rhetoric is not defended by the First Amendment
Four Iranian nationals were indicted Tuesday for allegedly being part of a multi-year ""malicious cyber ops"" campaign targeting the U.S. State and Treasury departments, defense contractors and two companies in New York.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed the indictment in a Manhattan federal court, charging Hossein Harooni, Reza Kazemifar, Komeil Baradaran Salmani, and Alireza Shafie Nasab with computer fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and other charges.
Along with the unsealing of the indictment against the four conspirators, the U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice program (RFJ) announced it was offering up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of the group and the defendants, the DOJ said.
The Treasury Department also announced sanctions against the four conspirators and other cyber actors.
CHINESE HACKERS PREPARING TO ‘PHYSICALLY WREAK HAVOC’ ON US CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE: FBI DIRECTOR
""Criminal activity originating from Iran poses a grave threat to America’s national security and economic stability,"" Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said. ""These defendants are alleged to have engaged in a coordinated, multi-year hacking campaign from Iran targeting more than a dozen American companies and the U.S. Treasury and State Departments. This case represents just one part of the U.S. government’s effort to counter the range of threats originating from Iran that endanger the American people.""
The indictment alleges that between at least 2016 through April 2021, Harooni, Kazemifar, Salmani, Nasab and others were part of a hacking organization accused of participating in a multi-year, coordinated campaign to conduct computer intrusions.
The hackers targeted over a dozen U.S. companies as well as the U.S. Treasury and U.S. State Department.

(Rewards for Justice X post)
Kazemifar, Salmani and Nasab worked for Mahak Rayan Afraz, a company based in Iran that offered cybersecurity services, but the DOJ alleges the company was just a front for their operation.
Those targeted in the private sector were cleared by defense contractors with security clearance granted by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), allowing them to access, receive and store classified information to conduct activities in support of DoD programs.
The alleged hackers also targeted an accounting firm and a hospitality company, both located in New York.

While conducting the hacking campaigns, the conspirators tricked email recipients into clicking on links that turned out to be malicious and infected the computers with malware.
In one campaign, the group targeted one victim, which resulted in over 200,000 employee accounts becoming compromised.
The hackers conducted another campaign in which they targeted about 2,000 employee accounts, the DOJ said.
As the group continued with their attacks, the hackers were able to access an administrator's email account belonging to a defense contractor. The access allowed the conspirators to establish unauthorized accounts that were used to send hacking campaigns to employees of another defense contractor and a consulting firm.

The indictment noted that Kazemifar was responsible for testing the tools used in the campaigns. He also allegedly worked for the Iranian Organization for Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense (EWCD), which is part of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
The U.S. has designated the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization.
Harooni, the indictment alleged, procured, administered and managed the group’s infrastructure – things like computer servers and software used to conduct the hacking operations.

He also allegedly used a real person’s passport to conceal his role in the campaign.
Salmani, like Kazemifar, tested the tools used to execute hacking campaigns, including that used against a hospitality company.
Nasab is accused of creating the infrastructure used in social engineering campaigns in which women were used to gain confidence from victims before deploying malware on their computers and devices.
All four conspirators were charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud. They face up to five years in prison for computer fraud conspiracy and up to 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

The DOJ said Harooni was also charged with knowingly damaging a protected computer, which has a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison if found guilty. The DOJ charged Harooni, Salmani and Nasab with aggravated identity theft, as well.

"AMERICAN VALUES: ‘It’s dying’: Parents, grandparents worry about future of American dream","Parents and grandparents told Fox News they feel like the American dream is getting more difficult — maybe impossible — for the next generation to reach. Here's why.
SAN DIEGO COUNTY, Calif. – Many parents and grandparents who spoke with Fox News have a dismal view of the American dream, saying they worry it’s ""dying"" or already dead for the next generation.
""They can't afford the American dream,"" Pat from Gilroy, California, said. ""What we wanted when we were young, it's not something our kids can afford.""
Many people visiting Coronado, California, in late March 2024 told Fox News they worried the American dream was dead or dying.

""We got ours, but our kids and our grandkids can't afford homes,"" she said, standing in a city where Zillow estimates the average home value is nearly $2.5 million. ""And they can't afford to do the things they'd like to do.""
Their doubt is shared across the nation — only 36% of voters polled last fall in a Wall Street Journal/NORC survey said the American dream still holds true, down from 53% in 2012.

"Rosa Parks, Jackie Robinson, MLK Jr. and other famous figures to remember during Black History Month","Former Olympian John Carlos and former NFL player Jack Brewer join Harris Faulkner on ‘The Faulkner Focus.’
Black history in the U.S. dates back to 1619, when enslaved Africans were brought to Jamestown colony – near present-day Williamsburg, Virginia.
Since then, Black Americans have persevered despite challenges throughout the nation’s history and left their mark on American culture.
Every February, the nation celebrates Black History Month by honoring the contributions and achievements of African Americans.
BLACK HISTORY MONTH QUIZ: TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS MONTH OF TRIBUTE
The theme for February is ""African Americans and the Arts,"" with festivals and events occurring in community centers across the U.S., according to the Association for the Study of African American Life and History.
From trailblazing abolitionists, scientists, athletes and artists to politicians, judges and civil rights leaders, numerous historical figures have done their part to shape America into the country it is today.
Frederick Douglass was born into slavery in 1818. (iStock)
Here are 13 famous figures and the contributions they made to American history.
Sojourner Truth was born in 1797 under the name Isabella Baumfree, in Ulster County, New York – where slavery was still legal at the time.
She escaped to freedom in 1826 with her infant daughter after her owner refused to comply with the gradual abolition of slavery law New York had passed, the National Parks Service reports.
Baumfree later freed her son, who had been sold to an Alabama slave owner, by bringing her case to court.
TARGET PULLS BLACK HISTORY MONTH PRODUCT FROM SHELVES THAT MIXED UP THREE CIVIL RIGHTS ICONS
By 1828, she became the first Black woman to win a case against a former slave owner.
Almost two decades later, Baumfree joined a Methodist church and changed her name to Sojourner Truth as she traveled the country to promote the abolition of slavery, the advancement of women’s rights, and religious tolerance.
Baumfree famously delivered her ""Ain’t I a Woman?"" speech in 1851 at the Ohio Women’s Rights Convention and met President Lincoln in 1864 through her work for the National Freedmen’s Relief Association. She also dictated a group of memoirs that were published in her book ""The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: a Northern Slave"" (1850).
Frederick Douglass, an American abolitionist and orator, was born as an enslaved person in Feb. 1818 in Talbot County, Maryland.
He became a national leader in the abolitionist movement in New York and Massachusetts after escaping bondage as a disguised sailor, according to the Library of Congress.
Douglass delivered moving speeches and essays about his experience and anti-slavery stance, including his ""What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?"" speech (1852) and ""Life and Times of Frederick Douglass"" autobiography (1881).

Douglass also fought for civil reforms, including equal treatment for Black Americans and women, free public education and the end of capital punishment.

Harriet Tubman, conductor of the Underground Railroad and a Union Army spy, was born in March 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland, under the name Araminta Ross.
She changed her name in 1844 following her marriage to John Tubman, a free man, the National Parks Service reports. About five years after her marriage, Tubman escaped to freedom in Philadelphia, where slavery was abolished.
Tubman spent the next decade of her life rescuing family and friends in what is now known as the Underground Railroad.
Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army.
She personally made ""about 13 trips into Maryland"" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to ""about 70 more,"" according to the NPS.
When the Civil War broke out in the 1860s, Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army. She famously joined Col. James Montgomery and his 2nd South Carolina Infantry during the group’s 1863 raid on Combahee River plantations, where Tubman provided scouting, nursing and cooking aid.
Agriculture scientist and educator George Washington Carver was born in the early- or mid-1860s in Diamond, Missouri.
While initially enslaved with his mother and sister, Carver was separated from his family after he was kidnapped in a slave raid. The Carver family retrieved him from his captors and eventually taught him to read, write and care for plants after the abolishment of slavery in 1865.

Carver went on to attend various schools in the Midwest. He was accepted into the botany program at the Iowa State Agricultural School and became the first African American to earn a bachelor of science degree, according to History.com.

Carver’s agricultural research and inventions led to advancements in soil health, conservation, and rotational peanut crops, the USDA reports.
Carver famously made a variety of peanut-based products and herbal concoctions, and later became a professor at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a historically Black college.
American journalist and civil rights advocate Ida B. Wells was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862, five months and two weeks before the delivery of the Emancipation Proclamation.
Wells moved to Tennessee and became a teacher in adulthood. Wells began to write political articles after she won a lawsuit against the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1887 for being forcibly removed from a first-class train car she paid for; that decision was ultimately overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court, Mississippi History reports.
Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP.
Wells went on to write exposés about school segregation and lynching in Memphis until she was forced to move to New York City for her safety. She continued her investigative reports about disparities in the American education system under segregation, mistreatment that African Americans experienced, and the road to women’s suffrage.
Some of her famous written works include ""Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases"" (1893) and ""Mob Rule in New Orleans"" (1900).
Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. She also ran for the Illinois legislature before her death in 1931.
American sociologist and historian William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on Feb. 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.
Du Bois was the first Black graduate of Searles High School in 1884 and later earned his bachelor of arts from Fisk University in Tennessee, America’s Library reports.
MEET THE AMERICAN WHO GAVE BIRTH TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, ALBERTA KING, ‘GAVE HER ALL FOR CHRIST’
He then earned a second bachelor’s degree, a master's and a doctorate in history from Harvard University. During his schooling, Du Bois also traveled to Germany for a fellowship at the University of Berlin, where he studied the works of famous social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller and Heinrich von Treitschke.
Du Bois became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.
Du Bois used his education and talents as a writer and editor to address race relations in the U.S. and advance rights for Black Americans. He published books on sociology, history and politics, including ""Black Reconstruction in America,"" ""The Souls of Black Folk"" and ""The Talented Tenth.""
Du Bois became a professor of history, sociology and economics at Atlanta University, a historically Black research college with Methodist roots. He also became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.
The NAACP characterizes itself as a grassroots organization that ""builds Black political power to end structural racism.""
Thurgood Marshall, the great-grandson of a slave, was the first Black justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. (Getty Images)
Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore.
He was formerly named Thoroughgood Marshall, but he legally changed his name at the age of 6. Marshall later became interested in the law as a high school student after he was ordered to read the U.S. Constitution as a punishment for a prank he pulled, United States Courts reports.
From that moment, he was inspired to become a lawyer after he realized not all African Americans were able to enjoy the liberties laid out in the Bill of Rights.
10 FACTS ABOUT BLACK HISTORY MONTH THAT ARE WELL WORTH KNOWING DURING OBSERVANCES IN FEBRUARY
Marshall attended Lincoln University and then Howard University School of Law, where he worked with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Around 1935, Marshall found counterarguments for segregation when he reviewed the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which stated facilities could be divided by race if they were ""separate but equal.""
Marshall found this doctrine flawed and created discrepancies in the education children received, which led him to take on and win several landmark cases.
His most famous case that changed the American school system was Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.
President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall as a federal judge to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1961. Four years later, Marshall was appointed as solicitor general by President Lyndon Johnson. By 1967, Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court – where he served as a justice until 1991.
Rosa Parks, civil rights activist, was born in 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama. (Getty Images)
Civil rights leader Rosa Parks was born on Feb. 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, under the name Rosa Louise McCauley. She married her husband, Raymond Parks in 1932 and worked as a seamstress before she became a member of the Montgomery National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Parks Service reports.
At age 42, Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat at the front of a bus to a White passenger and move to the back, a practice that wasn’t uncommon during the time of Jim Crow.
The arrest inspired 17,000 African Americans to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which lasted for 13 months and hurt the city bus service’s revenue. Parks remained a symbol of resilience during this time.
The boycott finally came to an end in 1956 when the Supreme Court ruled that segregated buses were unconstitutional. Parks moved to Detroit a year later, working with the NAACP and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., to fight homelessness, and even created a job training institute.
She earned a Congressional Gold Medal in 1991.
Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman to serve in the United States Congress, was born in Brooklyn, New York, on Nov. 30, 1924, under the name Shirley Anita St. Hill.
In her youth, Chisholm was partially raised by her grandparents in Barbados before her family settled in Brooklyn, the U.S. House of Representatives reports.
Chisholm earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from Brooklyn College and a master's in elementary education from Columbia University. She worked as a teacher, day care center director and educational consultant before entering politics.
Chisholm was elected to the New York state legislature in 1964 and then the U.S. House of Representatives in 1968, when she represented Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant district for seven terms. Chisholm made waves in the House when she appealed her initial committee assignment in agriculture to find a committee more relevant to her district.

She was reassigned to the Veterans Affairs Committee and moved up to the Education and Labor Committee, where she dedicated herself to advancing equal education and employment opportunities. In 1972, Chisholm, a Democrat, also became the first African American to run for a major political party's nomination for president.

Civil rights leader Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born on Jan. 15, 1929, in Atlanta. Post-college, King dedicated his life to fighting racial inequality with peaceful resistance to unjust laws.
He notably protested segregation in public schools, restaurants and hotels with nonviolent sit-ins, America’s Library reports. King also delivered moving speeches that challenged the mistreatment that African Americans faced under Jim Crow laws and called for equality.
King delivered his most famous speech, ""I Have a Dream,"" on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.
King's notable accomplishments during the Civil Rights Movement (1954-1968) included the Montgomery Bus Boycott; pleading for peace when U.S. marshals were called in to disperse the Freedom Riders (segregation protesters riding on interracial buses) in Montgomery; and leading the Voting Rights March from Selma to Montgomery, which was met with violent resistance.
However, it showed the world the assaults that African Americans faced during peaceful protests through photos and video.
Ruby Bridges started her civil rights work at a very young age.
On Sept. 8, 1954, Bridges was born in Tylertown, Mississippi. A couple of years after her birth, her family picked up and moved to New Orleans, Louisiana.
When the federal court ordered Louisiana to desegregate in 1960, Bridges was the only African American to attend the all-White school, William Frantz Elementary in New Orleans.

Bridges' first year in school was met with challenges. She was escorted by four federal marshals upon entering the school each day. Every day of the school year, she made it through the threats and anger directed toward her.
There was only one teacher, Barbara Henry, who was willing to teach young Bridges, who was taught through one-on-one instruction.
Bridges paved the way for many who followed her in the coming years, with more African American students enrolling.
Bridges kept up her civil rights work throughout her life. In 1999, she established The Ruby Bridges Foundation to create change in education and a more inclusive society.
In 2001, she was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Bill Clinton.
Claudette Colvin has a story similar to one often heard about Rosa Parks, although it happened nine months prior.
On March 2, 1955, when Colvin was 15 years old, she was riding the bus when the driver told her to give up her seat and move to the back.
Colvin refused, expressing that she paid for her ticket, and it was her constitutional right to be in the seat she was in.
Colvin was put in handcuffs and taken off the bus by two police officers for her refusal to give up her seat.
Colvin was one of the four plaintiffs who were part of the case Browder v. Gayle. This case ruled Montgomery’s segregated bus system unconstitutional.

Jackie Robinson was the first African American baseball player in modern years to play in the Major Leagues.
He was born on Jan. 31, 1919, in Cairo, Georgia. He played sports at both Pasadena Junior College and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he excelled in football, baseball and track.

It was April 15, 1947, when he first played for the Brooklyn Dodgers. He received a lot of heckling from fans while playing for the team, with some of his teammates refusing to play with Robinson.
He played for the Dodgers until he retired in 1956. He became the first African American to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962 and was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan in 1984.

5 things to know about MLK Jr. and the legacy of the civil rights icon,"Alveda King, niece of Martin Luther King Jr., reflects on his legacy on ""Fox and Friends Weekend.""
The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who spent his life fighting American injustice, was born Jan. 15, 1929, and his birthday, which was made a federal holiday late in 1983, is celebrated every year on the third Monday in January.
From King's opposition to war and dedication to eradicating poverty to the relentless fight against segregation, his influence echoes through history, inspiring generations toward justice, equality and social change.
Explore King's profound journey as we unravel the lesser-known facets of his legacy.
MARTIN LUTHER KING JR: THE LIFE AND THE LEGACY
The idealization of King and the years following his assassination have obscured the radical nature of his vision. Toward the end of his life, the civil rights leader criticized the Vietnam War and the disparities in the American economy.
King had come to the conclusion that both militarism and poverty were hindering the U.S. from fulfilling its ideals.
""I oppose the war in Vietnam because I love America,"" King told an audience at New York’s Riverside Church in 1967. ""I speak out against this war, not in anger, but with anxiety and sorrow in my heart, and, above all, with a passionate desire to see our beloved country stand as the moral example of the world.""

During the spring of 1968, King achieved successes in the realms of desegregation and voting rights. While strategizing his Poor People’s Campaign, he shifted his focus to Memphis, the rugged city in Tennessee along the Mississippi River. Advocating for the rights of striking sanitation workers, King aimed to organize marches, illustrating the effectiveness of nonviolent protest.
At the age of 39, the pioneer of nonviolence in the American civil rights movement met his tragic end on the evening of April 4, 1968, in Memphis. He was shot and killed by James Earl Ray, who was later captured in the UK. By then, King had already emerged as one of the most globally recognized figures.
The next day, King’s closest confidant, the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, said, ""Tighten your belts and dry your tears. If you love Martin Luther King as you say you do, help me carry on his work.""
MARTIN LUTHER KING JR’S ‘DREAM’ FOR A BETTER AMERICA HAD ROOTS IN THE HEBREW BIBLE
The members of King’s tight circle barely paused to grieve. They plunged into carrying out his unfinished work and turned it into a lifelong vow.
Several entered the political arena while a handful persisted in contributing to the organization King spearheaded or initiated their own ventures. Others returned to the pulpit, advocating a gospel of racial liberation.
King fought for many progressive issues throughout his life as a monist er and the leader of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, speaking out against various systemic barriers holding back Blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans.

He famously delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech during the 1963 March on Washington, calling for equality among the races.
King played a pivotal role in orchestrating the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 after Rosa Parks' arrest for declining to surrender her seat on a city bus.
Just four days after Parks' arrest in Montgomery, Alabama, King passionately encouraged a gathering at Holt Street Baptist Church to initiate a bus boycott.
""Now let us go out to stick together and stay with this thing until the end,"" he told the thousands gathered at the church that day in 1955.
ALVEDA KING SAYS OF MLK'S ICONIC SPEECH, 57 YEARS LATER: 'WE STILL HAVE A DREAM'
A federal court ended racial segregation on Montgomery public buses, elevating King into the national spotlight.
Years later, he stood behind President Lyndon Johnson at the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned segregation in public places and employment discrimination on the basis of race or national origin.
King advocated for the passage of federal civil rights laws, which were ultimately implemented, earning him the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his impactful contributions.
King's involvement in the 54-mile march from Selma, Alabama, to the state capital of Montgomery raised awareness about the challenges faced by Black individuals in their efforts to register to vote.

Following attacks on marchers by White mobs and police, Johnson delivered a compelling address in a special session of Congress, effectively persuading lawmakers to pass the Voting Rights Act.
King left a lasting impact. In the 1970s and 1980s, the American South witnessed the election of thousands of Black individuals to various offices, a stark contrast to the nearly nonexistent representation in the 1950s.
Coalitions of Black and Latino communities emerged in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Houston, working together to elect individuals of color to both local and federal offices. Eventually, these efforts played a role in the election of the nation's first Black president.
As King approached the end of his life, his progressivism took on a more radical stance, leading to an intensification of backlash against him.
MARTIN LUTHER KING JR DAY MUST BE FOR ALL OF US
""We have fought hard and long for integration, as I believe we should have, and I know that we will win. But I've come to believe we're integrating into a burning house,"" King said. ""I'm afraid that America may be losing what moral vision she may have had. …. And I'm afraid that even as we integrate, we are walking into a place that does not understand that this nation needs to be deeply concerned with the plight of the poor and disenfranchised. Until we commit ourselves to ensuring that the underclass is given justice and opportunity, we will continue to perpetuate the anger and violence that tears at the soul of this nation.""
In a Gallup poll from 1966, 63% of the American public held a negative opinion of King. According to an early Harris Poll from 1968, the iconic leader died with a public disapproval rating reaching nearly 75%. Following King's assassination, 31% of Americans told Gallup that they believed he ""brought it on himself.""

While the leader favored the influence of morality over the allure of popularity, the latter has grown throughout the years, giving credence to his statement: ""The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.""
King’s example, and his insistence on nonviolent protest, continues to influence many activists pushing for civil rights and social change.
The legacy of service and political empowerment left by King has inspired generations to advocate for political and social reforms aligned with his principles of pacifism and unity.","The hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/martin-luther-king-jr-what-to-know-about-the-civil-rights-leader,5

"North Korea issues nuclear 'warning signal' to US, South Korea","Korth Korean leader Kim Jong Un views a simulated nuclear counter attack drill. (Credit: Associated Press)
North Korea’s missile test on Monday was in fact a drill to test nuclear force preparedness, according to local media.
The incident raised alarms around the region after several short-range ballistic missiles were launched near Pyongyang and flew approximately 185 miles before falling in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
The drill’s main purpose, however, was to ""demonstrate the reliability, superiority, might and diverse means"" of the country’s nuclear forces and the Haekbangashoe system that serves as ""a clear warning signal to the enemies"" of North Korea, according to the Pyongyang Times.
The Haekbangashoe system, which means ""nuclear trigger,"" included the maneuver of troops into a ""counterattack posture"" that aimed at ""substantially strengthening the prompt counterattack capacity of the state nuclear force.""

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reportedly oversaw the drill, which occurred as the U.S. and South Korea started a combined joint formation drill at Kunsan Air Base, which commenced on April 12 and is expected to end April 26. He reportedly likened the weapon system to ""the firing of a sniper’s rifle.""
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff claimed that any reports of such accuracy or capabilities of its weapons system were likely exaggerated, and that South Korea’s military could detect and intercept any weapons.

To combat North Korea’s aggressive pursuit of nuclear preparedness, Washington, Tokyo and Seoul agreed to a system of real-time missile data-sharing, which would allow the three countries to monitor Pyongyang’s launches, according to Newsweek.
U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said the launch ""does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory, or to our allies,"" stressing instead the ""destabilizing impact of the DPRK’s illicit weapons program.""

The U.K. on Tuesday pledged an additional $620 million in new military supplies for Ukraine, including long-range missiles and four millions rounds of ammunition, at a time when Ukraine is struggling to hold off advancing Russian forces on the eastern front line of the war, now in its third year.
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday morning to confirm the assistance and ""assure him of the U.K.’s steadfast support for Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s brutal and expansionist ambitions,"" Sunak's office said.
Sunak was traveling to Warsaw later Tuesday to meet with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg for talks about further aid for Ukraine.

Ahead of the visit the U.K. government said Sunak would announce $620 million in new British military supplies, including 400 vehicles, 60 boats, 1,600 munitions and 4 million rounds of ammunition. The shipment will include British Storm Shadow long-range missiles, which have a range of some 150 miles and have proved effective at hitting Russian targets.

US and South Korea to hold talks in Hawaii on cost sharing for American troops,"Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg (Ret.), former adviser to VP Pence, on the latest from the war in Israel and potential backlash facing Netanyahu.
U.S. and South Korean officials will meet in Hawaii this week for talks on sharing the cost of keeping American troops in South Korea, with the U.S. seeking ""a fair and equitable outcome"" that will strengthen the alliance, the U.S. State Department said on Monday.
The two sides named envoys last month to launch early talks for a new deal to take effect in 2026. South Korean media said the aim was for an agreement before any November election comeback by former President Donald Trump, who during his presidency accused Seoul of ""free-riding"" on U.S. military might.
The State Department said the first meeting on the so-called 12th ROK-U.S. Special Measures Agreement would be held in Honolulu from Tuesday to Thursday.

During Trump's presidency, the sides struggled for months to reach a deal before Seoul agreed to increase its contribution by 13.9% over the previous 2019 pact under which Seoul had paid about $920 million annually, the biggest annual rise in nearly two decades.

Barry Manilow did not think 'Copacabana' would be a hit,"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.
Barry Manilow recalled how he initially didn't think one of his most iconic songs would be a hit.
During an interview with NBC News, the 80-year-old singer explained that he ""never"" knows when a song he creates will become a success.
""I just write them. And if I'm lucky, I make a great record out of it. And that's it. That's all I know,"" Manilow said.

Manilow was then asked to name a song that he ""really did not put [his] money on.""

""'Copacabana,'"" Manilow admitted of the 1978 classic that he co-wrote with lyricists Bruce Sussman and Jack Feldman.
He continued, ""It was fun to write it. It was fun to make a great record of it. And, that was it.""
Manilow remembered that he and his co-producer at the time, Ron Dante, doubted that the song would even get airplay.
""It sounded really great, but it was a novelty card,"" he remembered. ""Nobody was making songs like that. We never thought it would ever get played on the radio.
""But we took it to a disco, when there were discos and, we asked the DJ to play it,"" Manilow continued. ""And everybody ran to the dance floor and started to dance like they were back in the 1940s. They were dipping the girls and all because, you know, it's ‘Copa.’ And, I said to Ron, we may be onto something with this one.
""And then, it turned out to be the most popular song in my catalog.""
The song won Manilow his first and only Grammy Award. ( Arturo Holmes/Getty Images)
Inspired by the legendary New York nightclub Copacabana, the song was featured on Manilow's fifth studio album ""Even Now."" ""Copacabana"" became the first certified gold single that Manilow wrote or co-wrote and reached No. 8 on the U.S. Billboard Charts.
Manilow received his first and only Grammy Award for ""Copacabana,"" winning him the trophy for best male pop vocal performance in 1979.

Due to ""Copacabana's"" success, Manilow, Sussman and Feldman produced the 1985 musical TV movie of the same name based on the song's story and lyrics with additional musical numbers. The trio later created a stage musical titled ""Copacabana,"" which debuted at London's West End and ran for two years.
""Copacabana"" went on to tour the United Kingdom for 18 months, and more than 100 productions of the musical have been staged around the world.

Manilow recently performed five sold-out concerts during his ongoing residency at Radio City Music Hall. The singer made history with his 42nd show at Radio City Music Hall, setting a record for the most performances by an artist at the iconic venue.
While speaking with NBC News, Manilow shared that he is still surprised by his own success as a musician.

""Because I wouldn't be surprised after all these years if they stopped coming,"" Manilow said. ""I really wouldn't be. They shouldn't be coming after all these years. And I'm so grateful that they still have a good time with me.""

""Sometimes I know they're not going to ever be heard,"" he said. ""I just love making music, I love creating. I'm a creator.""

Soprano Asmik Grigorian makes Metropolitan Opera debut in Puccini's 'Madame Butterfly',"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Asmik Grigorian laughs when she recalls that she had been singing professionally for more than a decade when the International Opera Awards proclaimed her the ""best young female singer"" of 2016.
""So for 12 years I was nothing, and then I immediately became the best!"" the Lithuanian soprano joked in an interview.
Now at the peak of her career and seemingly able to sing just about any role she chooses, from Dvorak’s lyrical ""Rusalka"" to Puccini’s dramatic ""Turandot,"" Grigorian is about to make her Metropolitan Opera debut in another Puccini classic, ""Madame Butterfly.""
30 YEARS AFTER FIRING, A SOPRANO RETURNS TO THE MET OPERA FOR A RECITAL
""My only regret is not having booked her sooner,"" said Met general manager Peter Gelb. ""Asmik is an operatic force of nature, one of the greatest and most complete vocal and acting packages in recent operatic history.""
Growing up in Vilnius she had plenty of exposure to opera. Both her parents, tenor Gegam Grigorian and soprano Irena Milkeviciute, were opera singers and both appeared at the Met, where Asmik traveled with them while a young girl.
In this image provided by the Met Opera, soprano Asmik Grigorian prepares for her Metropolitan Opera debut during a rehearsal for Puccini's ""Madame Butterfly.""  (Jonathan Tichler/Met Opera via AP)
When she launched her own career, she took pains not to trade on the family fame.
""I was pretty successful in that,"" Grigorian said, ""because even now many people say, ‘Oh you have the same name, you know he was a great tenor,’ and I say ‘Yeah, I know, he was my father.’""
It took her many years from her 2004 debut in Norway at age 23 as Donna Anna in Mozart’s ""Don Giovanni"" to achieve the combination of dramatic intensity and seamless vocalism that have opera houses around the world competing for her talents.
""In the beginning I always had a reputation as a pure stage animal who is not really 100% able to control my voice,"" she said. ""It was true.
""I was too young,"" she added. ""Control demands experience, so of course I failed a thousand, million times and this is an amazing thing to do. I think it’s the biggest sadness of the generation now because we are so visible and people are not allowing themselves to fail anymore, and how can you develop without failing?""
Eventually the lack of a dependable vocal technique caught up with her. ""You come to the age where you can’t just rely on nature,"" she said. ""I hurt my voice, I hurt my body, I hurt everything.""
By 2012, she said, ""I could not sing anything any more. And I decided, OK I have two choices: I can continue killing myself, or I start from the beginning.""
Grigorian worked hard for years to build her technique and knew she had succeeded when a critic said ""she is perfect technically, and it’s so boring because she is not so interesting as an actress.""
""Then I thought, now I did it!"" Grigorian, 42, said. ""But when you are so focused on technique it’s a bit too cold."" Finding she could trust her voice allowed her to flourish again as a performer ""and a different type of magic"" started to happen.
Triumph after triumph followed. Of her 2018 Salzburg role debut as Salome in the Richard Strauss opera, Financial Times critic Shirley Apthorp raved that ""hers is a Salome to end all Salomes … Grigorian’s charisma sweeps it all in her wake.""
Three years later when she made her debut at the Wagner shrine in Bayreuth, Germany, as Senta in ""The Flying Dutchman,"" Joshua Barone in The New York Times called her performance ""luxuriously lyrical"" and noted she was ""met with a roaring ovation.""
Acclaim also greeted her last year when she took on two parts many thought would be too taxing for her voice: Verdi’s Lady Macbeth in Salzburg and Turandot in Vienna.
Her fellow singers seem as enthusiastic about her as critics and audiences.
""She is the best partner I’ve ever had on stage. End of discussion,"" said tenor Joshua Guerrero, who recently sang opposite her in ""Madame Butterfly"" at London’s Royal Opera House. He cited in particular ""her willingness to remove ego and to put the other person forward when they are singing their part.""
As Butterfly, Guerrero said she brought to the role ""a beautiful stillness … She played it very naively, with a childlike approach.""
Grigorian explains: ""I like to hear a lyrical sound with very tender colors because she’s a 15-year-old girl.
""But at the same time, it’s pretty challenging,"" she said, because a singer with too light a voice will struggle to be heard over Puccini’s thick orchestral textures.
To avoid a steady diet of heavier roles, Grigorian is diligent about mixing up her repertoire.
""I definitely don’t consider myself a dramatic soprano or a Wagnerian soprano,"" she said. ""If I sing something dramatic, I put something lyrical in the middle so I keep my flexibility.""
That’s why it comes as only a mild surprise to hear that — despite misgivings — one of her new roles for next season in Vienna is the Druid princess heroine of Bellini’s ""Norma,"" a part that demands the utmost dexterity with its long lyrical lines and rapid ornamentation.

""I have no clue. I never did any bel canto,"" she said. ""I’m very nervous and probably I will be the worst Norma on the planet. But I do that because I need to keep my voice flexible. I want to learn many new things.""
Grigorian is at the Met this season for five performances starting Friday, with the last one on May 11 to be shown live in movie theaters. But she’ll be back in future seasons to sing ""Salome,"" Janacek’s ""Jenufa"" — and no doubt more.","Who's making headlines in television, music, movies and more from Hollywood to the Heartland.",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/soprano-asmik-grigorian-makes-metropolitan-opera-debut-puccinis-madame-butterfly,S
"Jerry Jones 'not ready to go' amid sluggish contract extensions for Dak Prescott, other Cowboys stars","Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Earlier this year at the Senior Bowl, Jerry Jones declared the Cowboys front office would go ""all-in"" this offseason. But so far, the offseason has been largely uneventful. Dallas has also not been particularly active in the free agent market.
The Cowboys roster already features a fair number of players on the roster who already carry sizable salary cap hits. The franchise is also weighing lucrative contract extensions for some of their key players. But, Jones, the longtime Cowboys owner and general manager, shouldered the blame for the lack of progress on the contracts.
""If you've got trouble with when the timing is around here,"" Jones said, ""it's because I'm not ready to go.""

Quarterback Dak Prescott, star wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and linebacker Micah Parsons are among the star players who are in line to land big pay days. Prescott has handled the starting quarterback duties for the past eight seasons.
The 30-year-old's contract expires after the 2024 season. He recently hinted that negotiations with the Cowboys have yet to kick off, but he added that he and Jones were ""aligned"" about where things stood.
COWBOYS' DAK PRESCOTT HAS NO 'FEAR' ABOUT FUTURE AS HE ENTERS FINAL YEAR OF CONTRACT
""Honestly, I'm focused on the moment, on the now,"" Prescott said. ""If the talks begin and real talks get to happen, sure, we can talk about getting that done, but in this case right now I'm worried about getting better, being better than I am at this moment. So leaving that up to my agent and Jerry at this point.""
Meanwhile, Lamb is set to play in the upcoming season under his fifth-year option. He could receive the franchise tag designation next year. Parsons, a three-time All-Pro, remains under his rookie contract, but he is eligible for the franchise tag after the 2025 season.

Jones expressed interest in seeing ""some more action"" as it relates to the contracts.
""You may be working on [contracts] and not moving anything but your eyebrows,"" Jones said. ""Who in the world would think that we're not working on it? I work on it. It pops up at 2 in the morning sometimes. What you're actually questioning is why don't you have something done and negotiated and put in the drawer? Well, we'd like to see some more leaves fall. We'd like to see some more action.""
Lamb and his agent could be waiting to see the terms of a contract Justin Jefferson potentially ends up getting from the Minnesota Vikings.

""You don't think the representatives of Jefferson and CeeDee and [Cincinnati's Ja'Marr Chase] aren't talking? You don't think they got their eye on something really big? Please,"" Stephen Jones, the Cowboys executive vice president, said.
""They're not ready to come in here. Same thing with Micah. Same thing with Dak. It's a little cat and mouse. And total respect for them.""
The Cowboys watched star offensive lineman Tyron Smith, running Tony Pollard and Tyler Biadasz sign with other teams this offseason.

Jerry cited the salary cap restraints that exist within the NFL when he discussed the inevitable departures of star players over the years.
""Dak has enjoyed, in his career that we're proud of, some of the best supporting casts that you could put around him,"" Jerry Jones said. ""To move forward, we will have to diminish that. That's a fact. That's the rules. That's our challenge and to make it work out: Dak as the quarterback of the Cowboys. I don't even have a blink on that one.""

"76ers' Tyrese Maxey was fouled twice by Knicks before New York's go-ahead three, NBA says","Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The New York Knicks’ wild sequence that ultimately led to Donte DiVincenzo’s game-winning three-pointer with 13 seconds to play shouldn’t have happened in the first place, according to the NBA’s Last Two Minute report of Game 2 with the Philadelphia 76ers.
The 76ers wanted calls when Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart were hounding Tyrese Maxey on an inbound pass after Brunson made a three-pointer to cut the Sixers’ lead to two late in the fourth quarter.
Maxey ended up falling down to the court, leading Hart to take the ball away, and DiVincenzo had two separate chances to take the lead, missing his first three before Isaiah Hartenstein got the offensive rebound, muscled it out to OG Annunoby, who found DiVincenzo for the lead.

The Last Two Minute report, which analyzes game-changing calls, and in this case no-calls, found that both Hart and Brunson should’ve been whistled for fouls on Maxey, who bobbled the inbounds pass but regained possession before losing the ball again.
""Brunson (NYK) pulls Maxey’s (PHI) jersey away from his body, which affects Maxey’s ability to secure the pass,"" the report states with 27 seconds remaining in the game.

Hart had his hands up as Maxey hit the deck, and he saw an opportunity to strip him of the ball and did so.
There is also a note in the report saying 76ers head coach Nick Nurse did attempt to call timeout, but that was ""neither recognized nor granted by the officials."" Nurse said after the game he tried to call timeout, but the officials didn’t see him.
Philadelphia is sending a grievance to the NBA over the officiating in the first two games of this first round series, per ESPN. With the league’s report, they have strong reasoning to do so.

Milan Lucic's wife, Brittany, filed for divorce on Monday night citing ""irreconcilable differences,"" according to TMZ Sports.
The Boston Bruins star was arrested in the early hours of Nov. 18 after an alleged domestic violence dispute. Brittany Lucic listed the date of their separation as the previous night.
Lucic took a leave of absence from the team following the alleged dispute and pleaded not guilty to assaulting her. He has not played since Oct. 21.

According to a Boston Police Department report, Lucic appeared intoxicated when officers arrived at his North End apartment early Saturday after his wife reported that he tried to choke her. Brittany Lucic told the responding officers that her husband had pulled her hair, but said he did not try to strangle her. She declined an offer of medical treatment.
The two got married on July 19, 2012, and the case was eventually dismissed in February after Brittany decided not to testify against her husband.
""The organization takes these matters very seriously, and we will work with the Lucic family to provide any support and assistance they may need,"" the team said in a statement at the time of his arrest.

We're obviously very concerned, upset for them and what they're going through, but we have a lot of support for (Lucic's wife) Brittany and the kids and Luc himself,"" team captain Brad Marchand said back in November.
Lucic is a veteran of over 1,300 NHL games with the Bruins, Los Angeles Kings, Edmonton Oilers and Calgary Flames. He won the Stanley Cup with Boston in 2011 and returned to the team for this season after signing a one-year free agent contract last summer worth $1 million with $500,000 in possible additional incentives.

Enhanced Games founder calls for 'reform' after Chinese swimmers' PED controversy,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said that 23 Chinese swimmers were allowed to compete in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics despite testing positive for a banned substance.
The WADA ruled that since the athletes were ""inadvertently being exposed to the substance through contamination,"" a claim initially brought by the Chinese Doping Agency, they were able to compete.
This is hardly the first PED scandal to hit the Olympics, which is part of the reason why Dr. Aaron D'Souza founded the ""Enhanced Games"" last year.

Dubbed the ""Olympics on steroids"" by its critics, the Enhanced Games are an upcoming Olympic-styled event in which performance-enhancing drugs are permitted.
D'Souza has long preached that his event is the epitome of fairness in sport, as there is quite literally nothing to hide. He also has said that with the amount of doctors regulating the athletes, it will also be one of the safest sporting events of all.
So, after the WADA made its ruling, D'Souza is calling for ""reform"" that is ""overdue.""
""For too long, the anti-doping regime has been marred by inefficacy and scandal, undermining the integrity of sports and betraying the trust of athletes worldwide,"" D'Souza said in a statement released on Tuesday. ""We offer a dual-pathway future where the Olympics could celebrate natural talent, and the Enhanced Games could safely showcase enhanced performance. This isn’t just an alternative; it’s a complementary solution, a harmonious existence for the natural and the enhanced athlete, bolstered by transparent, effective drug testing and open collaboration.

The WADA said it had been given a tip by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency as early as 2020 — before this case arose — about allegations of doping cover-ups in China but that USADA never followed up with evidence.
However, the WADA said they ""reviewed this case thoroughly"" and ""concluded that there was no concrete basis to challenge the asserted contamination.""

""History at the end of the day repeats itself,"" he said. ""What we have seen back in the 30s with the harassment and intimidation of Jewish people across Europe, back when Jewish students were not allowed to universities and people were creating human chains in order to block Jewish students from entry.""
""Jewish students are being intimidated and harassed on college campuses. I was on a call with a Jewish student and that goes to Columbia University, and she said, 'I can't wait to pack my bags and get on the first flight home. I don't want to be on this campus anymore.'""

Sinelnikov said that Jewish students no longer feel safe at one of the nation's ""most prestigious universities.""
""When you get to the point, when in our most prestigious universities, Jewish students don't feel safe to walk on those campuses because they're afraid of being harassed or afraid of being physically assaulted,"" he said. ""When you see all of that, the similarities are frightening.""
Sinelnikov reminded people that the Holocaust ""didn't happen overnight,"" but slowly seeped into society.
""People need to be aware that this is what's happening in the highest educational institutions,"" he said.

""What happened in the Holocaust, it didn't happen overnight,"" he added. ""There were years and years of indoctrination and the hatred that was spread, especially towards youth, especially in the educational systems against the Jewish people.""

The SSI Movement founder said that Jewish people are portrayed as ""subhuman"" on college campuses.
""And this is what you see today on our campuses, you know, so they try to portray Jewish people as subhuman,"" he said. ""People chant, ‘kick out all the Zionists.’""

Sinelnikov said that while watching the footage of antisemitism on campus, it's hard not to observe the striking similarities between the Holocaust and modern-day antisemitism.
""You cannot just ignore the similarities between that and what has happened now,"" he said. ""Some people might think that we are overexaggerating, but the fact is, when a bad thing happens in our history and when people also think that it will never happen, it will happen.""
""This is the writing on the wall that we have on our college campuses and our higher education system,"" Sinelnikov said.

Sinelnikov said that the worst thing that could happen is for Jewish students to leave universities.
""At the end of the day, people might feel intimidated or unsafe or afraid. But, the worst thing we can do is to leave those spaces,"" he said. ""The worst thing that could possibly happen is for Columbia University to become a Jew-free university,""
""They want to harass, intimidate, terrorize students until those students are not going to show their face anymore. And we just cannot let it happen,"" he said.

He said that the biggest problem universities are facing is lack of campus leadership.
""I think the biggest challenge that we're facing right now and across the country, it's lack of leadership by the academic institutions and by the universities, because at the end of the day, if you really think about it, a lot of these problems can be solved quickly,"" he said.
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY MOVES TO HYBRID LEARNING ON MAIN CAMPUS AMID ANTISEMITIC PROTESTS
""A lot of people might argue here for the sake of freedom of speech or freedom of assembly, but at the same time, we need to remember that we're not talking about student's freedom, we're talking about harassment, intimidation,"" Sinelnikov said. ""We're talking about open calls for violence against Jewish students.""
Anti-Israel protesters demonstrate in front of police outside Columbia University in New York City on Thursday.  (Peter Gerber)
Sinelnikov said that Columbia University's president ""lacks the will to take the right actions.""
""At Columbia University, the president called in the police to remove the protesters, but all the students were released from the police station at 10 p.m. and the protesters were back out on a different side of the lawn a few hours later, and it's still there today,"" he said.

""And what happens now is that students who pay $60,000 a year for tuition have their whole semester to be moved online, because the university cannot take control of 300-400 students on their campus,"" Sinelnikov said.

This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).
A 10-year-old child woke up after his father ""hunted"" down his older brothers and mom in a disturbing murder-suicide inside a suburban Oklahoma home, police said.
Jonathon Candy, 42, had an argument with his wife, Lindsay, which spiraled out of control. He grabbed a gun and fatally shot his wife ""multiple times"" and ""systematically went through the home shooting the children,"" Oklahoma City Police Sgt. Gary Knight said.
Responding officers found the 10-year-old outside alive, but his brothers — Dylan, 18, Ethan, 14, and Lucas, 12 — were all killed before Jonathan turned the gun on himself, according to police.
""Make no mistake. What happened in that residence was nothing short of a massacre,"" Knight said during a Tuesday press conference. ""The children were hunted down and killed.""

Unfathomable confusion shrouded the murders for hours after responding officers found the dead family Monday morning and a 10-year-old boy outside the house.
Knight described the scene inside the Yukon, Oklahoma, home as ""carnage.""
""It remains a mystery as to what caused Mr. Candy to murder his wife and three of his children,"" according to police, which said there were no previous domestic incidents at the Yukon, Oklahoma home, a suburb of Oklahoma City.

Los Angeles authorities arrest suspect in shooting of deputy at traffic light,"A Los Angeles County deputy riding a marked motorcycle was shot in the back in West Covina. The suspected gunman remains on the run, FOX 11 Los Angeles reports.
The person who allegedly shot a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department motorcycle deputy in the back while he was stopped at a red light has been arrested, Los Angeles police say.
Raymundo Duran, 47, was arrested in San Diego County, according to officials. He was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving and possession of illegal weapons.
At a press conference on Tuesday, Sheriff Robert Luna said that Duran is a gang member with an extensive rap sheet.
""He has a very extensive criminal history, a very violent criminal history,"" Luna said.

""At the end of the day, this man was armed with a firearm. He had no business having a firearm in his possession with his criminal history,"" he added.
The shooting happened just before 3 p.m. Monday near Interstate 10 at the intersection of North Barranca Street and East Garvey Avenue, according to FOX 11 Los Angeles.
LA County Sheriff Robert Luna credits a bulletproof vest Deputy Samuel Aispuro, 43, was wearing at the time of the shooting for saving his life.
Aispuro was in uniform and was riding a department-issued motorcycle at the time of the shooting. He was taken by ambulance to a medical center for treatment and, according to Luna, the vest that he was wearing saved his life.
Authorities immediately began searching for a white sedan with tinted windows, last seen heading west on Interstate 10 from Barranca Street. They eventually found Duran and arrested him.

Aispuro is now recovering at home. He has been with LASD for nearly two decades, FOX 11 LA reports, and is married with two young children.
During the press conference, Luna took a moment to thank the witnesses who helped officials with their investigation.
""The witnesses that came forward immediately when our deputy was shot in the back, I can't say enough about them,"" Luna said. ""They saw what they saw, got out of their cars, went immediately to aid our deputy…and eventually their information became very important to the investigation that our homicide detectives are conducting.""

FBI director has been sounding alarm on ‘heightened threat environment’: Is America listening?,"FBI Director Christopher Wray warns he has never seen a threat environment as America currently faces, with 'blinking lights' flashing from China, the border, and terrorism threats at the same time
Whether it’s terrorism, China, or an insecure border, the U.S. faces a litany of threats both internally and internationally, according to the FBI.
FBI Director Christopher Wray has repeatedly warned of a ""heightened threat environment,"" and has pleaded with lawmakers to take each one seriously.
Connecting all of these disparate threats is the FBI’s ability to adequately address them. At a House Appropriations Subcommittee earlier this month, Wray said the FBI’s fiscal year 2024 budget was around $500 million below what the bureau needed to sustain its 2023 efforts.

Wray said the budget shortfall ""could not have come at a worse time"" given that the U.S., according to the bureau, is in a ""heightened threat environment.""
""As I look back over my career in law enforcement, I would be hard-pressed to think of a time where so many threats to public safety and national security were so elevated all at once, but that is the case as I sit here today,"" Wray told House lawmakers.
His comments came days before the House passed a $95 billion aid package in military aid for Ukraine and Israel.
""After Oct. 7 is when we went to a whole other level.""
Here is an assessment from the FBI Director of some of the top threats the U.S. faces in the coming months and years.
CHINA
Of all the threats the U.S. faces, the FBI has signaled that China far outweighs them all. According to Wray, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has built up a vast cybersecurity and counterintelligence apparatus devoted to theft of intellectual property and criminality.
Wray spoke about the threat posed by China during a summit on Modern Conflict and Emerging Threats at Vanderbilt University last week.
China’s hacking program, Wray said, was larger than that of every other major nation combined – and that’s only magnified by the PRC’s military and growing use of artificial intelligence.
""You could close your eyes and pull an industry or sector out of a hat and, chances are, Beijing has targeted it.""
To give a sense of the scope of the PRC’s operations, Wray said that even if the bureau’s top cyber agents and cyber intelligence analysts were focused solely on China – and not on ransomware, Iran, or Russia – ""Chinese hackers would still (conservatively) outnumber FBI cyber personnel by at least 50 to 1.""
He said Beijing has hit just about every American industry – whether it be biotech, aviation, AI, health, or agriculture – to steal U.S. intellectual property.
CHINA SPENDING ‘DRASTICALLY MORE’ ON MILITARY THAN DECLARED, US ADMIRAL SAYS
""You could close your eyes and pull an industry or sector out of a hat and, chances are, Beijing has targeted it,"" Wray said. ""The PRC is engaged in the largest and most sophisticated theft of intellectual property and expertise in the history of the world, leveraging its most powerful weapons, starting with cyber.""
Wray previously told lawmakers that there has been far too little public focus on the fact that PRC hackers are targeting the U.S.’ critical infrastructure ""in preparation to wreak havoc and cause real-world harm to American citizens and communities.""

China’s malign efforts, Wray said, are driven largely by the Chinese Communist Party’s ""aspirations to wealth and power,"" as it seeks to seize economic development in the areas most critical to tomorrow’s economy.
Compounding these threats is China’s long-term goal to retake Taiwan. Per Wray, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence last year assessed that Beijing was building out its capability to deter U.S. intervention in a potential crisis between China and Taiwan by 2027.
Wray warned in January that the PRC had ""circled"" the year 2027 on its calendar and will ""be on us before you know it.""

""I do want the American people to know that we cannot afford to sleep on this danger. As a government and a society, we’ve got to remain vigilant and actively defend against the threat that Beijing poses,"" Wray said in January. ""Otherwise, China has shown it will make us pay.""

At that same hearing, Wray called China’s ""multi-pronged assault"" on our national and economic security ""the defining threat of our generation.""
BORDER
Securing the border remains a top issue for American voters, particularly amid the rise of suspects on the terrorist watch list as well as the proliferation of deadly fentanyl into communities nationwide.
Wray told lawmakers at a House Appropriations Subcommittee on April 11 that the bureau continues to see drug cartels pushing ""fentanyl and other dangerous drugs into every corner of the country.""
""Let’s not forget that it didn’t take a big number of people on 9/11 to kill 3,000 people.""
He noted at Vanderbilt University last week that many of fentanyl’s precursor chemicals that end up in our communities ""are coming out of China.""
At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in December, Wray said the bureau had seized enough fentanyl to kill 270 million people.
SENATE WON'T PASS BORDER SECURITY LEGISLATION THIS YEAR, JOHNSON'S OFFICE SUGGESTS
""That’s about 80% of all Americans,"" Wray said. ""We’re also focused on other threats that emanate from the border and impact communities all over the country, things like violent gangs and human traffickers.""
At the same hearing, Wray said terrorists' ability to ""exploit any port of entry, including our Southwest border, is a source of concern.""

""There’s a lot of discussion about numbers – and numbers are important – but let’s not forget that it didn’t take a big number of people on 9/11 to kill 3,000 people,"" he said, noting that the bureau has seen an increase in ""suspected terrorists attempting to cross (the border) over the last five years.""

Asked by Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., in December whether the U.S. was seeing the largest terrorist threat since 9/11, Wray said the threat was ""higher than it’s been in a long, long time.""
""I see blinking lights everywhere I turn,"" Wray told Graham.
TERRORISM
Wray said earlier this month that the U.S. was at a ""heightened threat level"" of terrorism even before Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas militants stormed into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages.
""After Oct. 7 is when we went to a whole other level,"" Wray told the House Appropriations Subcommittee on April 11.

Wray said the FBI has seen a ""rogue’s gallery of foreign terrorist organizations calling for attacks on us.""
HEZBOLLAH CLAIMS TO SHOOT DOWN ISRAELI DRONE OVER LEBANON
This includes Hezbollah in Lebanon praising Hamas and threatening to attack U.S. interests in the region. It includes Al Qaeda issuing its most ""specific call for an attack"" on the U.S. in the past half-decade.
AQAP, which is Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, as well as ISIS have called for jihadists to attack Americans and Jewish communities in the U.S. In Afghanistan, home to Al Qaeda and ISIS-K, the U.S. has lost some of its intelligence gathering capabilities following the chaotic withdrawal of U.S.

Wray also pointed to the growth of other terrorist groups in Africa like Al Shabab – the best funded branch of Al Qaeda – as well ISIS’s attempt to ""free some very dangerous fighters"" in Syria.
Wray said these terrorist groups typically don’t see eye to eye, but are united in one thing: calling for attacks on the U.S.

""When organizations like Al Qaeda, like ISIS, express an intent to conduct attacks against us, it is something we need to take very seriously,"" Wray said. ""And so, that’s part of why I’ve highlighted this as a heightened threat.""

Ruby Leaning, 10, was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia after collapsing on the school playground in Jan. 2020, according to SWNS, the British news service.
The rare blood cancer required an urgent bone marrow transplant to keep the 6-year-old alive.

They are notoriously private, but a source recently gave some insight into their relationship, telling People magazine why the couple decided to move their kids out of Los Angeles.

""So proud of my man. So much hate when he took on this role,"" Mendes posted on Instagram in January 2024. ""So many people trying to shame him for doing it.

""He has many . . . writings about it, how it’s easy to be cocky and arrogant,"" Shannon shared. ""It’s harder to be honest and express who you really are. [But] there’s this narrative being spread now that he was this angry, arrogant, cocky person.
""He was extremely confident, which I think can be mistaken for arrogance sometimes. He cared intensely about doing things well. . . . We tend to want to put people in a box and say, ‘This is what this person was like.’ But the truth is, those people didn’t know him, or they only crossed paths with him very, very briefly.""

""That’s something I’m trying to correct,"" Shannon added.
Lee died in 1973 at the height of his fame, due to an allergic reaction to painkillers. Over the years, Shannon has heard numerous conspiracy theories surrounding the circumstances of her father’s passing.
Some have alleged that Lee’s death was covered up and instead, that he had taken a drug overdose. Some claimed he was poisoned by a jealous lover. Others insisted he was assassinated by rival gangs. And for some, he was simply a victim of a family curse.

The theory of a so-called curse intensified when Shannon’s brother, Brandon Lee, died in 1993 after an accidental shooting while filming ""The Crow."" He was 28.
In response to those rumors, Shannon said that it only speaks to ""the greatness of my father's life.""
Shannon, who was four when her father died, admitted that her memories of Lee are hazy. But his presence never left her.

""The thing that I remember the most about him is how he felt to me,"" said Shannon. ""I have a very strong feeling of a sense of warmth, a sense of attention, a sense of playfulness, a sense of strength. He instilled in me a sense of safety and a sense of love that I get to carry with me throughout my whole life.
""For a long time, when I was growing up, I was really confused about why I felt like I knew this person so well, so strongly, given that my mental memories, my visual memories, are not that strong. But it’s because of the feeling he gave me.""

Her mother, 79, has continued to share many stories about the patriarch.
""When my parents had my brother, my dad was really excited, because he had a son,"" said Shannon. ""For Chinese men, a firstborn son is really important. So he was really proud and excited. And then my mom was like, ‘I think we should have another child.’ He was like, ‘If I could have another son that would be great.’ Then I came along.

Shannon described her household as one filled with love. Linda told her that she had never laughed so much in her life as when she was married to Lee.
""Most people tend to think of my father’s life as starting in the United States,"" said Shannon. ""That’s where he met my mother, that’s where he opened his schools, and that’s where he was discovered by Hollywood. His career took off from there.

"Millions have moved out of certain parts of the country now designated “Climate Abandonment Areas""","Climate change has driven 3.2 million people out of certain areas of the country.  (iStock)
More frequent flooding is leaving lasting damage, even as neighborhoods rebuild. Certain areas of the country are being deemed ""Climate Abandonment Areas."" These areas are losing a large percentage of their population entirely due to climate change, specifically flooding, according to a First Street report.
Climate Abandonment Areas include 818,000 U.S. Census blocks. Over 3.2 million people have moved away from these areas between 2000 and 2020 due to flooding damage.
""There appears to be clear winners and losers in regard to the impact of flood risk on neighborhood level population change,"" Dr. Jeremy Porter, the head of climate implications research at the First Street Foundation, said.
""The downstream implications of this are massive and impact property values, neighborhood composition and commercial viability both positively and negatively.""
In the next 30 years, current Climate Abandonment Areas are expected to lose more of their populations. The populations are expected to decline by an additional 16%, equivalent to 2.5 million more people.
""The population exposure over the next 30 years is a serious concern,"" Evelyn Shu, a senior research analyst at the First Street Foundation, said.
""For decades we’ve chosen to build and develop in areas that we believed did not have significant risk, but due to the impacts of climate change, those areas are very rapidly beginning to look like areas we’ve avoided in the past.""

CLIMATE DISASTERS ARE DRIVING UP THE COST OF INSURANCE AND IMPACTING HOME VALUES: REPORT
Of the 50 U.S. states, California is struggling the most with high homeowners insurance rates. Sky-high homeowners insurance rates are due, in part, to natural disasters like wildfires and mudslides.
Citing the high risk and the costs associated with those risks, State Farm recently announced it will not continue to insure homes in certain areas. It’s cutting 72,000 home and commercial insurance policies. These cuts impact around 30,000 homeowners and rental insurance policies specifically.
""We will continue to work constructively with the California Department of Insurance, the Governor’s Office, and policymakers to actively pursue these reforms in order to establish an environment in which insurance rates are better aligned with risk,"" the State Farm press release stated.
Starting July 3, 2024, and continuing through the year, State Farm will begin pulling out of the California homeowners insurance market.
The same issue is happening in Florida, where Progressive has begun to pull some of its insurance policies. Starting in May 2024, to ""rebalance their exposure"", they’ll stop renewing some policies.
If you want to find a new homeowners insurance provider that offers lower rates, Credible can walk you through each homeowner's insurance policy, the coverage they offer and show you the rates you may qualify for.
2023 WAS THE HOTTEST YEAR ON RECORD, DRIVING UP UTILITY COSTS AND HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE PRICES
While homeowners insurance rates are definitely on the rise, they’re not rising as much as principal and interest payments on mortgages, a Freddie Mac report found.
The cost of buying a home has skyrocketed over the last few years, largely due to high mortgage rates. That said, homeowners insurance still contributes significantly to the total cost of homeownership.
In 2018, homeowners insurance premiums averaged $1,081 for Freddie Mac borrowers, but in 2023, they averaged $1,522 annually. That’s a 40.8% increase.
Freddie Mac found that in 2018, premiums accounted for 1.49% of borrowers’ incomes. This rose by 10% by 2023 when 1.64% of a borrower’s income went towards monthly premiums.
Certain states pay higher premiums than others. Louisiana, Kansas, Nebraska and Mississippi pay over $8 for every $1,000 in home value. All the while, borrowers from California, Washington, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, DC all paid less than $2.50 for $1,000, according to the Freddie Mac report.

"76% of buy now, pay later users said it helped improve their financial situation but beware of risks: survey","One way to juggle BNPL accounts is by keeping track of them, according to a recent Achieve survey. (iStock)
A growing number of consumers who use buy now, pay later (BNPL) services and are attracted to their ease of access, but they are at risk of becoming overextended, according to a recent survey.
Over a third (34%) of respondents said they liked BNPL services because they allowed them to pay for purchases over time without paying interest, while 22% liked the option because it was easier to access than credit cards, according to the Achieve survey. Additionally, 76% said BNPL helped them improve their overall financial situation.
BNPL providers partner with retailers to allow shoppers to split the cost of their online purchases into multiple installments at checkout. Part of the appeal is that the installment payments, which typically begin within a few weeks of the purchase, are interest-free. Plus, the payment option requires no credit check or down payment, as in the case of credit cards or layaway.
However, the survey said that BNPL is sometimes used by consumers with poor credit histories who are already debt-stressed. Moreover, 78% of respondents said that it is easy to get overextended using BNPL.
""Buy now, pay later isn't an inherently flawed financial product,"" Achieve Co-Founder and Co-CEO Brad Stroh said. ""But like any form of credit, consumers must use it responsibly and only borrow what they can repay. Lenders must also be responsible and intentional about their borrowers and the potential for harm inherent in the BNPL product.""
BNPL is just one alternative to credit cards. If you need help funding a large purchase, a personal loan could be a good option for you. You can visit Credible to find your personalized interest rate without affecting your credit score.
GAS, HOUSING AND CAR INSURANCE COSTS SOAR, FUELING INFLATION IN MARCH
Missed BNPL payments can result in late fees and other penalties. Financially overextended consumers who used BNPL products showed more signs of debt stress—such as higher debt levels and lower credit scores—than those without, according to the survey. However, only 16% of respondents said they've incurred a late fee for missing a BNPL payment, and 20% said they've been charged interest on a BNPL transaction.
Additionally, a separate survey by BNPL provider Klarna said that consumers who relied on BNPL had better outcomes than traditional credit card users. Roughly 96% of Klarna's U.S. BNPL customers paid early or on time, outperforming 41% of credit card users revolving monthly. In 2023, utilizing Klarna's interest-free Pay in 4 option, 31% of customers paid bills early, 65% paid on time, and only 4% incurred late fees. Conversely, 41% of American credit card users carry month-to-month debt.
""We still see too many of the traditional banks and credit card companies pushing products on consumers with exorbitant interest rates, hidden fees, and revolving debt,"" Klarna Chief Commercial Officer David Sykes said. ""It is very clear that the traditional credit card model does not work in the favor of the vast majority of customers.""
If you have taken on debt through buy now, pay later and need help paying it down, a personal loan could help. Visit Credible to compare multiple personal loan lenders at once and choose the one with the best interest rate for you.
AMERICANS TAP INTO SAVINGS AS THEY STRUGGLE WITH INFLATION: SURVEY
More than half (56%) of the respondents in the Achieve survey said that keeping track of multiple BNPL transactions takes a lot of work. Keeping a running list of all outstanding BNPL transactions is one way to get ahead of managing your debt.
Achieve recommends that consumers note each transaction, the name of the BNPL provider, the number of payments remaining, the payment amount and how payments are made. Consumers should also consider BNPL products like any other form of credit, spend within their limit and have a repayment plan in mind before they make large purchases. They should also opt for autopay to avoid late fees for missed payments.
""Whenever possible, pay from a checking account rather than a credit card to avoid incurring interest charges for these purchases later on, just make sure you always have enough money in your account to cover the monthly payment to avoid overdrafting,"" Achieve said.
If you are looking for alternative forms of credit to help fund a large purchase, you could consider using a personal loan. Visit Credible to make sure you're getting the best rate and lender for your needs.

"Dave Ramsey reveals why it's so 'difficult' to start a business today, which generation has the advantage","Ramsey Solutions founder Dave Ramsey discusses younger generations buying small businesses, entrepreneurship in America and trade schools appealing to Gen Z.
Small businesses are statistically the backbone of the American economy. But even personal finance guru Dave Ramsey points out that it’s a tough time to embark on an entrepreneurial journey.
""It's emotionally difficult right now. It is very hard right now,"" Ramsey told ""The Big Money Show"" co-host Brian Brenberg, Monday, at the EntreLeadership Summit in Dallas, Texas.
""And guess what? It always has been,"" the Ramsey Solutions founder expanded. ""If you were in the 70s, you had the Vietnam War, right? If you were in the 80s, you had inflation. You just name it, there's always something telling you not to do it.""
Data from Forrester showed a surge of younger generations scooping up existing small businesses, with 64% of all buyers being born after 1980 as of February 2023. Despite the spike, Forbes reported this January that Boomers and Gen X still own the majority of U.S. small businesses, at a combined 87%.
CAREER COACHES EXPECTING 2024 LAYOFF WAVE, ‘FIERCE’ JOB COMPETITION: HERE'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO
Last August, a poll of 50,000 American business owners showed only 4.5% of respondents were considering growing or expanding their business over the next year.
Ramsey Solutions founder Dave Ramsey reacted to more younger generations buying existing businesses on ""The Big Money Show."" (Fox News)
Ramsey reacted to the idea that aging and retiring owners may potentially be setting up a golden opportunity for a generational handoff.
""The millennials and Gen Zers are the buyers. And you've got a huge opportunity, possibly to start your own thing. You may not need to be a buyer, you may just want to start something from the ground up,"" Ramsey told future business leaders. ""So you kind of keep that in your back pocket while you're doing the negotiation.""
""And for the boomers, hey, don't be a control freak. Bless the next generation,"" he continued. ""Turn them loose. They're capable. They can do it.""
Ramsey Solutions founder Dave Ramsey argues the daughter is now 'well-prepared for life' because of the parents' decision to charge rent.
Though previously showing some tough love to younger generations for their criticism of his money management tips, Ramsey admitted they’ve taken advantage of the ""easiest"" and ""best"" ways to get ahead in business.
""You've got YouTube and podcasting, and all of it's free,"" he said. ""From an economic standpoint, you can come and go quickly, easily, you can iterate, you can change, and it's all digital. You don't have to throw it all in the dumpster if you did it wrong.""
With reportedly between 400 and 500 Gen Z employees at Ramsey Solutions, the financial firm’s patriarch shared words of encouragement for what he’s learned to be a ""wonderful"" workforce.

'A New Kind of Diversity' author and Growing Leaders President Tim Elmore discusses 'bridging the gap' culturally between Gen Z and their elder generations in the workplace.
""They're wonderful because they're very serious, and they're very practical and tactical. They're not head in the clouds, they're not all dreamy. They're like, ‘I want to get it done,’"" Ramsey said of their attitudes.
His best advice for younger workers, though, is to go into mixed-collar trades – otherwise, they ""can get a four-year degree in German polka history and be a barista.""

"Today's 15-year mortgage rates go down while 30-year mortgage rates hold steady | April 23, 2024","Mortgage rates fluctuate almost daily based on economic conditions. Here are today’s mortgage rates and what you need to know about getting the best rate. (iStock)
The interest rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.500% as of April 23, which is 0.125 percentage points lower than yesterday. Additionally, the interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 7.500%, which is unchanged from yesterday.
With mortgage rates changing daily, it’s a good idea to check today’s rate before applying for a loan. It’s also important to compare different lenders’ current interest rates, terms, and fees to ensure you get the best deal.
Rates last updated on April 22, 2024. Rates are based on the assumptions shown here. Actual rates may vary. Credible, a personal finance marketplace, has 5,000 Trustpilot reviews with an average star rating of 4.7 (out of a possible 5.0).
When you take out a mortgage loan to purchase a home, you’re borrowing money from a lender. In order for that lender to make a profit and reduce risk to itself, it will charge interest on the principal — that is, the amount you borrowed.
Expressed as a percentage, a mortgage interest rate is essentially the cost of borrowing money. It can vary based on several factors, such as your credit score, debt-to-income ratio (DTI), down payment, loan amount, and repayment term.
After getting a mortgage, you’ll typically receive an amortization schedule, which shows your payment schedule over the life of the loan. It also indicates how much of each payment goes toward the principal balance versus the interest.
Near the beginning of the loan term, you’ll spend more money on interest and less on the principal balance. As you approach the end of the repayment term, you’ll pay more toward the principal and less toward interest.
Your mortgage interest rate can be either fixed or adjustable. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the rate will be consistent for the duration of the loan. With an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), the interest rate can fluctuate with the market.
Keep in mind that a mortgage’s interest rate is not the same as its annual percentage rate (APR). This is because an APR includes both the interest rate and any other lender fees or charges.
Mortgage rates change frequently — sometimes on a daily basis. Inflation plays a significant role in these fluctuations. Interest rates tend to rise in periods of high inflation, whereas they tend to drop or remain roughly the same in times of low inflation. Other factors, like the economic climate, demand, and inventory can also impact the current average mortgage rates.
To find great mortgage rates, start by using Credible’s secured website, which can show you current mortgage rates from multiple lenders without affecting your credit score. You can also use Credible’s mortgage calculator to estimate your monthly mortgage payments.
Mortgage lenders typically determine the interest rate on a case-by-case basis. Generally, they reserve the lowest rates for low-risk borrowers — that is, those with a higher credit score, income, and down payment amount. Here are some other personal factors that may determine your mortgage rate:
Other indirect factors that may determine the mortgage rate include:
Along with certain economic and personal factors, the lender you choose can also affect your mortgage rate. Some lenders have higher average mortgage rates than others, regardless of your credit or financial situation. That’s why it’s important to compare lenders and loan offers.
Here are some of the best ways to compare mortgage rates and ensure you get the best one:
One other way to compare mortgage rates is with a mortgage calculator. Use a calculator to determine your monthly payment amount and the total cost of the loan. Just remember, certain fees like homeowners insurance or taxes might not be included in the calculations.
Here’s a simple example of what a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage might look like versus a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage:
If you’re thinking about taking out a mortgage, here are some benefits to consider:
And here are some of the biggest downsides of getting a mortgage:
Requirements vary by lender, but here are the typical steps to qualify for a mortgage:
Here are the basic steps to apply for a mortgage, and what you can typically expect during the process:
Refinancing your mortgage lets you trade your current loan for a new one. It does not mean taking out a second loan. You will also still be responsible for making payments on the refinanced loan.
You might want to refinance your mortgage if you:
The refinancing process is similar to the process you follow for the original loan. Here are the basic steps:
If you need to tap into your home’s equity to pay off debt, fund a renovation, or cover an emergency expense, there are two popular options to choose from: a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Both a home equity loan and a HELOC allow you to borrow against your home’s equity but a home equity loan comes in the form of a lump sum payment and a HELOC is a revolving line of credit.
These two loan types have some other key similarities and differences in how they work:
Interest rates on mortgages fluctuate all the time, but a rate lock allows you to lock in your current rate for a set amount of time. This ensures you get the rate you want as you complete the homebuying process.
Mortgage points are a type of prepaid interest that you can pay upfront — often as part of your closing costs — for a lower overall interest rate. This can lower your APR and monthly payments.
Closing costs are the fees you, as the buyer, need to pay before getting a loan. Common fees include attorney fees, home appraisal fees, origination fees, and application fees.

How to remove Facebook access to your photos,"Kurt Knutsson reveals how to remove unwanted photos invading your Facebook page.
Raise your hand if you’ve ever skimmed through the user agreements and legal jargon that appear when signing up for new software or services. (If you aren’t raising your hand right now, you probably should be.) No one enjoys sifting through this dense information.
Unfortunately, by not reading service agreements thoroughly, you might inadvertently grant services access to things you’d prefer they didn’t have. For instance, you may have unknowingly allowed the Facebook app to access the photos stored on your phone or tablet during the download process.
If you’d rather not give Facebook this level of access to your stored photos, you can modify the permissions even after installing the app. We’ll guide you through the steps to protect your privacy concerning your photographs. Note that some images, like your profile picture and cover photo, are always visible to Facebook.

In today’s interconnected world, the ability to communicate across language barriers is more important than ever. Apple has recognized this need and, in a recent iOS update, introduced a nifty feature that allows you to translate languages instantly without even opening the Translate app.

Tidy up your tech: Spring-cleaning tips for safeguarding your data,"Safeguarding your digital life with a reliable physical backup isn't just a precaution, it's a necessity. Kurt Knutsson provides the essential backup checklist.
It happens without warning. Suddenly, access to your personal data gets interrupted by a simple hardware failure, nasty virus, cyberattack, software glitch, accidental deletion or human mistake. It's clearer than ever that our personal data is vulnerable.
As an advocate for privacy and security, and the editor behind the popular CyberGuy Report, which you can subscribe to for free at CyberGuy.com/newsletter, I have always emphasized the importance of personal responsibility when it comes to data security. My top recommendation for protecting your precious memories, critical documents and the mountains of personal data we accumulate is straightforward: utilize a personal drive for backups.

Spring is traditionally a time for cleaning, and this should extend to digital hygiene as well. Each year, I undertake a thorough cleaning of my personal data, making sure to back up documents, family photos and other irreplaceable items. There's nothing quite like the peace of mind that comes from having a physical backup, which places control firmly in your hands, irrespective of whether you use a Mac, PC or even a Chromebook.

It easily connects to your device via SuperSpeed USB 3.0, ensuring quick and efficient data transfer and is fully compatible with Chromebook. A reliable drive like this is a must-have; I use another similar WD model for my MacBook and PC.

When deciding what to back up from your computer, it's crucial to prioritize documents, files and memories that are important and irreplaceable. Here's a comprehensive list to consider.
1) Personal documents: Include items like birth certificates, passports, social security cards, marriage certificates, wills and other legal documents that could be difficult or time-consuming to replace.
2) Financial records: This category should cover bank statements, tax returns, investment records and other financial documents that are essential for personal record-keeping and legal compliance.
3) Photos and videos: Family photos, vacation videos, special events like weddings or graduations and other personal memories that cannot be recreated.
4) Work and educational documents: If you use your computer for work or school, ensure you back up important projects, research papers, presentations and related correspondence.
5) Emails: Some emails might contain important information, agreements or attachments that you may need to refer back to. Consider backing up important emails or archiving them.
6) Contacts: A backup of your digital address book can save you a lot of trouble in case you lose access to your devices.
7) Music and media collections: For those who collect music, movies and books digitally, backing up these files ensures you don’t lose your collection.
8) Software and app data: Back up settings and data for apps that you use frequently, especially if they help manage your schedule, finances or health.
9) Website bookmarks: If you rely on bookmarks to navigate the internet efficiently, backing them up can save time if you need to restore or switch to a new device.
10) Game saves and profiles: If you're a gamer, backing up your game saves and profiles can prevent loss of progress in case of system failure.
11) Creative works: Include writings, artwork, design files, coding projects or any other personal or professional creative work.
The reality of digital threats, whether from ransomware attacks, viruses or even technical glitches in the cloud, is not a matter of ""if"" but ""when."" By maintaining a physical backup of your most crucial data, you ensure that in the event of a digital catastrophe, what matters most remains safe in your hands.
Woman on phone and laptop (Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)
Remember, safeguarding your digital life with a reliable physical backup isn't just a precaution, it's a necessity. This spring, take the time to protect yourself from potential future data disasters. Unplug your backup drive and store it in a safe place. It's a simple step that could save you a lot of heartaches.

Barry Manilow did not think 'Copacabana' would be a hit,"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.
Barry Manilow recalled how he initially didn't think one of his most iconic songs would be a hit.
During an interview with NBC News, the 80-year-old singer explained that he ""never"" knows when a song he creates will become a success.
""I just write them. And if I'm lucky, I make a great record out of it. And that's it. That's all I know,"" Manilow said.

Manilow was then asked to name a song that he ""really did not put [his] money on.""
Barry Manilow recalled that he didn't think his iconic song ""Copacabana"" would become a hit. (Getty)
""'Copacabana,'"" Manilow admitted of the 1978 classic that he co-wrote with lyricists Bruce Sussman and Jack Feldman.
He continued, ""It was fun to write it. It was fun to make a great record of it. And, that was it.""
Manilow remembered that he and his co-producer at the time, Ron Dante, doubted that the song would even get airplay.
""It sounded really great, but it was a novelty card,"" he remembered. ""Nobody was making songs like that. We never thought it would ever get played on the radio.
""But we took it to a disco, when there were discos and, we asked the DJ to play it,"" Manilow continued. ""And everybody ran to the dance floor and started to dance like they were back in the 1940s. They were dipping the girls and all because, you know, it's ‘Copa.’ And, I said to Ron, we may be onto something with this one.
""And then, it turned out to be the most popular song in my catalog.""
The song won Manilow his first and only Grammy Award. ( Arturo Holmes/Getty Images)
Inspired by the legendary New York nightclub Copacabana, the song was featured on Manilow's fifth studio album ""Even Now."" ""Copacabana"" became the first certified gold single that Manilow wrote or co-wrote and reached No. 8 on the U.S. Billboard Charts.
Manilow received his first and only Grammy Award for ""Copacabana,"" winning him the trophy for best male pop vocal performance in 1979.

Due to ""Copacabana's"" success, Manilow, Sussman and Feldman produced the 1985 musical TV movie of the same name based on the song's story and lyrics with additional musical numbers. The trio later created a stage musical titled ""Copacabana,"" which debuted at London's West End and ran for two years.
""Copacabana"" went on to tour the United Kingdom for 18 months, and more than 100 productions of the musical have been staged around the world.

Manilow recently performed five sold-out concerts during his ongoing residency at Radio City Music Hall. The singer made history with his 42nd show at Radio City Music Hall, setting a record for the most performances by an artist at the iconic venue.
While speaking with NBC News, Manilow shared that he is still surprised by his own success as a musician.

""Because I wouldn't be surprised after all these years if they stopped coming,"" Manilow said. ""I really wouldn't be. They shouldn't be coming after all these years. And I'm so grateful that they still have a good time with me.""

Manilow explained that he loves the process of creating music, even if some of his songs don't go on to become hits like ""Copacabana.""
""Sometimes I know they're not going to ever be heard,"" he said. ""I just love making music, I love creating. I'm a creator.""

"Fake James Bond trailer with Henry Cavill, Margot Robbie goes mega-viral","Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.
Sorry to break to everyone, but Henry Cavill and Margot Robbie aren't starring in a new James Bond film.
Thanks to AI, it's very easy to fake things these days on the internet. In fact, it's pretty easy to fake things to a degree that the untrained eye can't even tell the difference.
While there are certainly advantages to artificial intelligence, the fact it can be used as a tool to manipulate and spread misinformation is certainly concerning.
That also now applies to movies.

MARGOT ROBBIE SAYS ACTING CAREER ALMOST ENDED AFTER 'THE WOLF OF WALL STREET'
The popular YouTube page KH Studio is known for creating fake/concept trailers for upcoming movies, and it uses AI technology to get the job done. Not only does the AI work, but the trailers are wildly realistic. That includes a fake promo for a new Bond film starring Robbie and Cavill.
It appears the fake preview combines AI generated footage with movies from previous Bond films and movies starring the pair.
The video has been viewed more than 3.5 million times since being posted a few days ago. Check it out, and let me know your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.
The trailer is generating so much attention that film sites that wouldn't generally touch something like this are going out of their way to debunk it.
LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS
What's interesting is that people in the comments seem to think the fake trailer is proof Cavill should be cast as the next 007:
The hunt is currently underway for the next Bond actor, and clearly, fans would be interested in seeing Cavill fulfill the role. He played a commando in ""The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,"" and did an exceptional job. This fake trailer won't have any impact on making a decision, but the reactions are interesting.
More than anything, this is a reminder that you have to be really careful with what you see online when it comes to things of this nature. There was a fake ""Eastbound & Down"" season five trailer that went mega-viral in 2022, and it was all over the place hyping people up before it could be debunked.

Oracle CEO announces plans to move world headquarters to Nashville,"UBS managing director Jason Katz and Interactive Brokers strategist Steve Sosnick reveal how investors can navigate conflicting messages in the stock market on 'The Claman Countdown.'
Oracle founder Larry Ellison announced Tuesday that he plans to move the software giant’s corporate headquarters to Nashville, Tennessee, which he added is at the center of the healthcare industry.
Ellison sat down with former Senate majority leader Bill Frist for an onstage conversation in Nashville, which was shared by Oracle Health on the social media platform LinkedIn on Tuesday.
The founder and executive chairman told Frist his company was moving its ""huge campus"" to Nashville, and it will ""ultimately be our world headquarters.""
""I shouldn’t have said that,"" Ellison quickly said, but there was no turning back because he disclosed information on his company’s future.

Ellison said Oracle’s move to Nashville will position his company as one of the major players in the healthcare industry, an industry Oracle is looking to expand its position in.
Back in 2022, Oracle acquired Cerner for $28 billion. The Kansas City, Missouri-based company provides software for managing electronic health records.
As Ellison elaborated on the company’s plans to move, he said Nashville is ""a fabulous place to live.""

He also said Nashville is ""the center of the industry we’re most concerned about, which is the healthcare industry.""

Ellison said the news site will have office buildings, a community clinic, restaurants, hotels and a concert venue — a floating stage on the lake for concerts to be held for the community.

LARRY KUDLOW: The Bidens are doing everything they can to stop liquified natural gas development and exports,"FOX Business host Larry Kudlow gives his take on the Biden administration's green energy push on 'Kudlow.'
I want to talk about the failure of Biden's Green New Deal climate bank ATM and the failure of all these Biden-subsidized offshore windmill projects.
Many of you don't know this, but the first windmills were built in 1200 A.D. in Holland. They were vertical and land-based, and I'm sure they worked reasonably well for their time. It was a technological breakthrough created to grind grains.
By the 19th Century, there were more than 9,000 windmills in Holland and an important power source. They were mainly used to power various industrial uses.

The trouble is, many of today's Joe Biden greenies want us to go back to the 19th Century. Actually, I suspect many of those greenies want us to go back to the 13th Century, but that's a separate topic.
Here's the problem: The Bidens have spent a fortune on subsidizing these gigantic offshore windmill projects, which just don't work. Please read the Wall Street Journal’s editorial on the collapse of New York state wind development.
General Electric has lost a fortune — $1.4 billion last year, and $2.2 billion the year before. The state subsidies come from the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, which spent well over $1 trillion to subsidize everything outside of fossil fuels.
Panelists Steve Moore and Tomas Philipson reacts to President Biden admitting he misnamed the Inflation Reduction Act on 'The Bottom Line.'
These huge wind turbines fall over, require expensive repairs and are completely non-economic. The Journal states that more than a dozen of these projects in the U.S. and Europe have been canceled or delayed in the last year.
GREEN ENERGY PROJECTS FACE STARK ENVIRONMENTAL, LOCAL OPPOSITION NATIONWIDE
Meanwhile, the cost of offshore wind, at least in New York, is about $150 per megawatt hour. But wait a second, the wholesale price for natural gas is around $30 a megawatt hour. So you would think businesses and consumers would go for the cheaper natural gas.
But no! No! Natural gas is a fossil fuel, and the greenies don't like fossil fuels. Actually, natural gas is a clean-burning fuel and is part of the long-term solution both for economic growth and climate change.
""Shark Tank"" star Kevin O’Leary discusses how the U.N.'s Climate Change Conference concurred that the world will not be able to quit fossil fuels just yet on ‘The Evening Edit.’
In the last 20 years or so, the increased use of natural gas has led to huge reductions in lead, particulates, smog and carbon monoxide. Indeed, according to the Committee to Unleash Prosperity Hotline, over the last five decades, GDP is up nearly 800%, while energy consumption has increased only 29%, and carbon emissions have actually fallen 60%.
This is the biggest carbon decline of any of the major economies in the world. Much of this grand, clean air progress can be traced to the increased use of natural gas, but the Bidens are stubborn. They won't acknowledge this.
BLUE STATE DELIVERS CRIPPLING BLOW TO GREEN ENERGY DEVELOPMENT, JEOPARDIZING BIDEN'S CLIMATE GOALS
Heck, even Europe has reclassified natural gas as a clean-burning fuel. Instead, the Bidens are doing everything they can to stop liquid natural gas development and exports. And, of course, they celebrated Earth Day by closing down 13 million acres in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve.
Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis reacts to Biden selling 26 million more barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves on 'The Big Money Show.'
And if Mr. Biden were to be re-elected with his Green New Deal gang, then get ready for massive electricity and other power shortages plaguing the American economy and everything in it.

Tesla notifies thousands in Texas and California of impending layoffs,"'Varney & Co.' host Stuart Varney discusses whether Elon Musk's latest technological gamble will pay off for investors.
Tesla let thousands of employees in two states know it will be axing their jobs during upcoming layoffs.
The notifications in California and Texas, where the electric vehicle (EV) maker has large presences, came in the form of WARN notices, according to reports.
In California, the planned Tesla headcount reductions will hit approximately 3,300 workers, The San Francisco Standard reported Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Texas will see almost 2,700 employees in Austin lose their jobs, according to the Austin American-Statesman.
The reported job cuts in the two states will together total roughly 6,000.

Tesla’s layoff plans, announced last week, will entail shedding 10% of its headcount around the world. The Texas-based company said at the time it had seen a ""duplication of roles and job functions in certain areas"" amid its ""rapid growth"" in recent years.
At the end of 2023, over 140,400 people had jobs at Tesla.

Young girl survives cancer thanks to little sister’s lifesaving donation: 'A perfect match',"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A young girl in the U.K. is in cancer remission thanks to her sister’s lifesaving bone marrow donation.
Ruby Leaning, 10, was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia after collapsing on the school playground in Jan. 2020, according to SWNS, the British news service.
The rare blood cancer required an urgent bone marrow transplant to keep the 6-year-old alive.
AI COULD PREDICT WHETHER CANCER TREATMENTS WILL WORK, EXPERTS SAY
After several tests, Leaning’s then 2-year-old sister, Mabel Leaning, came up as a ""perfect match.""
The Leaning sisters' grandmother, Amanda Fawcett, confirmed to SWNS that Ruby Leaning received treatment with Mabel Leaning’s stem cells.

Ruby Leaning was declared cancer-free in 2022 — meaning Mabel Leaning ""saved Ruby’s life for sure,"" Fawcett said.
""She's a happy, normal and healthy 10-year-old who loves swimming, dancing and piano lessons.""
""We [weren’t] expecting her to be a match at first, but thankfully she was, so we just couldn't believe our luck,"" she said.
""It was amazing – we were so thankful.""

Fawcett recalled the moment her granddaughter was diagnosed with cancer at Sheffield Children’s Hospital.
""It's just every parent and grandparent's nightmare,"" she said to SWNS.

Fawcett described her granddaughters as ""so close,"" telling SWNS that they are ""amazing girls.""
""They've got a great relationship between them,"" she said.

"Dallas-area church highlights importance of adoption, foster care at 'Chosen' conference","Social media influencer Alyssa McKay joins 'America Reports' to tell her compelling story.
A Dallas-area megachurch recently hosted a conference with the goal of enabling Christians and their congregations to help address the foster care crisis in the United States.
The ""Chosen"" conference, held on April 13 at Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Texas, aimed to ""empower, engage, and equip"" attendees to establish foster care ministries at their churches and to effectively serve as foster parents.
The conference welcomed about 2,000 attendees, including several hundred who streamed online, Fox News Digital was told.
KIDS IN FOSTER CARE SEE DREAMS COME TRUE, THANKS TO NEW JERSEY NONPROFIT ONE SIMPLE WISH
""We feel that we need to marshal as many resources as humanly possible"" to bring awareness to foster care, said Rev. Jeremiah Johnston, pastor of apologetics at Prestonwood Baptist Church and founder of the Christian Thinkers Society.
The biggest and most important of those things is ""to raise awareness that the most unreached ‘people group’ in the world right now are children, and specifically what society calls ‘unwanted children,’"" he said.
A scene from the recent Chosen conference, which is ""the largest conference that we know about from a religious standpoint focused on the adoption and foster care crisis,"" said Rev. Jeremiah Johnston, pastor of apologetics at Prestonwood Baptist Church.  (Prestonwood Baptist Church)
Johnston, however, rejects that way of thinking.
""We believe that every child is indeed a ‘wanted child,’"" he said.
""Chosen,"" whose name was inspired by Deuteronomy 7:6 — ""The Lord has chosen you out of all the people on the face of the earth to be his treasured possession"" — is also the name of Prestonwood Baptist's foster care and adoption ministry.
Foster parents ""need to be encouraged. They need to be resourced. They need to be celebrated.""
Foster care, said Johnston, ""is such a battle.""
""It can be heart-wrenching. The rug can be pulled out from under you,"" he said.
Foster parents, he said, ""need to be encouraged. They need to be resourced. They need to be celebrated.""
FOSTER MOM’S VIRAL TIKTOK ON MISCONCEPTIONS BEHIND CARING FOR TEENS GETS LOVE FROM MILLIONS
If churches in the United States were able to effectively mobilize on this topic, Johnston said he believes they could solve the foster care crisis in the United States.
""There are 400,000 children right now in foster care in the United States,"" he said.
Of those, ""100,000 of those right now are available for adoption, and just need a family. [Some] 20,000 age out annually.""
Speakers at the conference included Korie Robertson, center, and Sadie Robertson Huff, far right, of ""Duck Dynasty."" Several of Korie Robertson's children are adopted.  (Prestonwood Baptist Church)
""This is a stark problem, especially one that is so easily addressed,"" he said, noting there are more than 350,000 religious congregations in the United States.
At Chosen, many of the hurdles associated with establishing an adoption or foster care ministry were taken care of, said Johnston.
Pastors who attended the Chosen conference ""essentially leave with a ‘ministry in a box,’ as it were,"" he said.
They have ""all the tools they need to go home and start an adoption/foster care ministry outreach through their local church.""
REDDIT USER BREAKS HEARTS WHEN HE SHARES NOTE FROM FOSTER DAUGHTER: 'PLEASE LOVE ME'
Johnston said he believes that right now, there is ""simply a lack of awareness"" about fostering and adoption in many church communities, rather than ambivalence or indifference.
""I think that so many pastors are just doing their own thing,"" he said. ""And so we want to help build awareness.""
""Every church can do something.""
He continued, ""No one church has to feel like they have to do everything. But every church can do something.""
Talking about the problem, he also said, is less effective than ""focusing on solutions.""
There are 100,000 children in the United States who are eligible for adoption. (Prestonwood Baptist Church)
Additionally, Johnston is hoping to ""push back on this narrative"" that Christians only care about babies until they are born.
""That is simply false,"" he said. ""We want to lead the way and be a pacesetter.""
He said he hopes ""for a vanguard of a new movement in the church through the rest of this.""

The church, he said, referring to Christianity in general, is ""the greatest force for good on planet Earth.""
He added, ""We believe the church should be the solution no matter what. And we're willing to stand on that and come what may … we're going to take care of children and not apologize about it.""

""We have to be unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing our labor in the Lord is not in vain,"" he said.

Military veteran embraces ‘new service’ of helping others after his Parkinson's diagnosis: ‘There is hope',"Fox News' Dr. Marc Siegel has the latest on the treatment of the brain disease on 'America Reports.'
After 17 years of serving his country, Mark Kelm is now providing a different type of service: He's advocating for others who, like him, are living with Parkinson’s disease (PD).
Kelm, who lives in a small Minnesota town with his wife of 23 years and three children, was just 38 years old when he was diagnosed with PD, a nervous system disorder that causes tremors, stiffness, loss of balance and other movement issues.
He credits his military background for preparing him for this latest challenge.
WHAT IS PARKINSON'S DISEASE? SYMPTOMS, CAUSES, WAYS TO COPE WITH DIAGNOSIS
""I believe the times that I had in the military really prepared me to handle living with a disease like Parkinson's — knowing how to adapt and overcome in any given circumstance,"" he told Fox News Digital in an interview.
""And I think those life skills that I learned in the Army are still quite useful today.""
After 17 years of serving his country, Mark Kelm is now providing a different type of service: He's advocating for others who, like him, are living with Parkinson’s disease. He's shown in the family picture at left, center, plus on the right.  (Mark Kelm)
Raised by a police deputy and a nurse, Kelm said that for as long as he can remember, his life has been geared toward service.
Since enlisting in the Army Reserves in 1989, Kelp has served many years of active duty, spent time in the National Guard and held a role as a military chaplain.
In 2006, Kelm transitioned to a role as a chaplain for a federal law enforcement agency.
Two years later, at just 38, he was alarmed when he started experiencing involuntary twitching.
RESEARCHERS FIND SOURCES OF FOUR BRAIN DISORDERS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO NEW TREATMENTS
""One muscle in my arm kept twitching, and it was causing my finger to twitch as well, and it just wouldn't stop,"" he recalled.
That began Kelm’s journey toward a diagnosis of young-onset Parkinson’s, which he received at the Mayo Clinic’s neurology department in Minnesota.
""That was a pretty dark day — knowing that it's a progressive, degenerative neurological disorder that currently does not have a cure or any disease-modifying drugs,"" he said.
Mark Kelm, pictured at right, enlisted in the Army Reserves in 1989 and served for many years in active duty. (Mark Kelm)
""As a chaplain, I performed funerals for people who had died from complications of Parkinson's. So I was very familiar with some of the end-stage aspects of the disease.""
Kelm started taking Levodopa, a central nervous system drug that helps to manage Parkinson's motor symptoms.
""I believe the times that I had in the military really prepared me to handle living with a disease like Parkinson's.""
For eight years, he ""stayed quiet"" on the disease. In 2016, he said, ""It was affecting me enough that I no longer could hide it.""
That’s when Kelm retired from full-time work — but his next chapter was just beginning.
""After having my own little pity party after my diagnosis, I realized that wasn’t really helpful,"" he said.
Kelm’s older daughter, who was in high school at the time, immediately started researching his disease. She soon became involved with fundraising and awareness efforts through the Parkinson’s Foundation.
Kelm, at right, is pictured on a mission trip to Uganda in 1998 while he was serving as a military chaplain. (Mark Kelm)
He was so impressed by his daughter’s efforts that he decided it was time to ""get off the bench and get back into the game.""
Kelm has since ""jumped in with both feet.""
He became the national chair of the Parkinson’s Foundation People with Parkinson’s Council, which ensures that the perspective of people living with PD is integrated into the foundation’s program development.
PARKINSON'S DISEASE SYMPTOMS DISAPPEARED WITH EXERCISE, MAN CLAIMS: ‘USE IT OR LOSE IT’
In 2020, Kelm helped create an annual Parkinson's Awareness Day at Target Field, in partnership with the Minnesota Twins.
He has also organized events to raise funds for the Minneapolis-based Struthers Parkinson's Center, and volunteers on the U.S. Department of Defense's medical research programs for Parkinson's.
""My service is connected to Parkinson's now,"" Kelm told Fox News Digital.
Kelm, at far right, is pictured with his family during a visit to the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee. (Mark Kelm)
""It has been an absolute blessing, because it's allowed me to meet people from all around this great nation and even the world,"" he went on.
""It's been very positive for me, and I’m very hopeful that there's a lot of research being done right now.""
Kelm’s advocacy could also indirectly benefit his health, according to Dr. James Beck, PhD, chief scientific officer for the Parkinson’s Foundation in New York City.
""My service is connected to Parkinson's now.""
""The symptoms of PD – slowness of movement, difficulty in movement, etc. – can shrink a person’s world,"" Beck told Fox News Digital.
""Mark’s effort to be involved and make a difference has helped him learn more about his own disease and to be a model advocate for his own care and health.""
People who are diagnosed with Parkinson’s before age 50 are considered early-onset patients.
Just 4% of people are diagnosed before the age of 50 — and Kelm was one.
Early-onset patients are three times as likely to have a genetic form of the disease, according to Beck.
In 2020, Kelm helped to create an annual Parkinson's Awareness Day at Target Field, in partnership with the Minnesota Twins. (Mark Kelm)
""People with EOPD typically have a much slower rate of progression of their disease than those diagnosed at an older age,"" Beck noted.
Younger patients, however, are more likely to notice stiffness earlier in the course of the disease.
""They will often experience dystonia (e.g., cramping of a hand or toes) as an early symptom,"" Beck said.
IS PARKINSON’S DISEASE, 'WORLD’S FASTEST GROWING BRAIN DISEASE,’ MOSTLY PREVENTABLE? STUDY OFFERS CLUES
Patients with early-onset disease will also often experience levodopa-induced dyskinesia (involuntary movements of body parts) more frequently than those diagnosed after the age of 50, according to Beck.
Kelm said he does experience dyskinesia from time to time.
""At first, I thought, ‘I’m going to beat this,’"" he said. ""And after a few years, I started having some swallowing issues, which led to choking while eating.""
Kelm is pictured with his wife of 23 years, Beth Kelm. ""She is the rock of the family. She does 99% of the work, and I go in for the 1% of glory."" (Mark Kelm)
""It was a wake-up call, and an awareness that I needed to do more to manage the disease.""
Coming to terms with his mortality was tough, Kelm acknowledged — but he found some comfort in knowing.
""I found peace in knowing that everything is going to be OK.""
""You don't die from Parkinson's — you die with Parkinson's,"" he said. ""You die from complications of the disease, especially if you're younger. And I found peace in knowing that everything is going to be OK.""
He added, ""All of us are going to leave this earth one way or another. Some of us are given knowledge beforehand, while others are not.""
There are currently more than 110,000 veterans with Parkinson’s disease who receive care through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), according to the Parkinson’s Foundation.
In 2009, the Health and Medicine Division of the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a report stating that there is ""suggestive but limited evidence that exposure to Agent Orange and other herbicides used during the Vietnam War is associated with an increased chance of developing Parkinson's disease.""
Second from right, Kelm is pictured delivering tailgate Communion while serving as a military chaplain. (Mark Kelm)
As the Parkinson’s Foundation stated, PD is a ""presumptive condition for veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange and certain other toxins during military service.""
Due to this designation, veterans with Parkinson’s who were exposed to these toxins are automatically eligible to receive health care and disability benefits from the VA.
Beck of the Parkinson’s Foundation said it makes sense that there could be a link between PD and military service.
MILITARY MENTAL HEALTH IS FOCUS AS AI TRAINING SIMULATES REAL CONVERSATIONS TO HELP PREVENT VETERAN SUICIDE
""Although I have not seen a report of a direct increase in PD after military service, given the environmental exposures of many of our service members – head trauma, solvent exposure, etc. – it would not surprise me to see a higher prevalence of PD among veterans,"" he told Fox News Digital.
Kelm noted that although the U.S. veteran population is getting smaller, the Parkinson's rate within the community is ""increasing significantly.""
Kelm and his family are pictured at the Minnesota Twins game on Parkinson's Awareness Day at Target Field. (Mark Kelm)
He told Fox News Digital, ""I suffered two TBIs (traumatic brain injuries) in service, which the VA believes likely contributed to my Parkinson's, along with chemical exposure.""
The Parkinson’s Foundation partnered with the VA in 2020 in an effort to improve the health, well-being and quality of life for veterans with PD and their loved ones.
Many military veterans with Parkinson’s find it difficult to bring themselves to ask for help after so many years of supporting others. This was the case for Kelm after his diagnosis.
""As a chaplain, my job was for people to come to me — not for me to seek them out.""
""I was in a pretty dark place at first,"" he recalled. ""As a chaplain, my job was for people to come to me — not for me to seek them out.""
A doctor at Struthers Parkinson’s Center in Minnesota recognized that Kelm needed help and physically walked him to a psychologist’s office.
BOOST BRAIN HEALTH AND SLOW MENTAL AGING WITH 10 INTRIGUING TIPS FROM LONGEVITY EXPERTS
""I sat down and started talking, and it really was my awakening — an awareness of how much I needed to listen to another person and have them sort through things.""
The psychologist helped Kelm realize that he could continue to serve others while also allowing others to serve him.
Second from right, Kelm is pictured during a mission trip to Uganda, during which the group helped to build a school for women. (Mark Kelm)
Over time, people in the Parkinson’s community began calling on Kelm to help others with young-onset PD who had recently been diagnosed.
""I want to reach out to as many people as possible and get them the help they need to live the best quality of life that they can,"" he said.
""I want to let them know that there is hope. It’s not all darkness — there is light. They still have a lot of life to live.""
During the harder days, Kelm finds encouragement and comfort in his faith.
""It’s the belief that no matter what happens, I don't have to fear, because I know God is is with me,"" he said.
""I have hope that as my body becomes weaker, God's strength will become more and more evident.""
""I have hope that as my body becomes weaker, God's strength will become more and more evident.""
Kelm said he is also optimistic that headway is being made toward improved Parkinson’s treatments and a future cure.
He is optimistic, said Kelm, that headway is being made toward improved Parkinson’s treatments and a future cure. ""The needle's moving in the right direction,"" he said. (Mark Kelm)
He is encouraged by the increases in fundraising and research.
""I'm hoping that I get to live until I'm 80 and chase grandkids around. But for that to happen, we're going to have to do the research, so that science can point us in the right direction.""

For others who are newly diagnosed, Kelm urges them to seek help and build a network — which may include a counselor or therapist, religious leaders, doctors, physical therapists or a speech therapist.
""Allow others to help you,"" he encouraged. ""It's hard at first. You might think you can fight the disease and manage the struggle on your own. But even Jesus had help carrying the cross.""
For veterans with Parkinson’s, Kelm urges them to seek support from the VA.
""I'm hoping that I get to live until I'm 80 and chase grandkids around,"" said Kelm, who is pictured with his family. ""But for that to happen, we're going to have to do the research, so that science can point us in the right direction."" (Mark Kelm)
""Look around, ask and talk to others, and you will find dedicated people who will allow you to flourish as you live with your Parkinson's disease.""
Beck echoed the importance of being open about a diagnosis to ""help bring Parkinson’s out of the shadows … It can be a difficult first step, but is worth it in the end,"" he said.

NASCAR Power Rankings: Talladega win boosts Tyler Reddick,"With the unpredictability of Talladega last week, there was little movement in these rankings except for two big jumps.
Tyler Reddick, with his win, went from sixth to second. That's because it marked his fifth consecutive top-10 finish, with three of those top-5s.
Brad Keselowski jumps back in the rankings after his second-place finish. It was his fourth top-5 in his last seven starts.
Of all the stats that I saw last week, the one that surprised me the most was that Chase Elliott has the best average finish of drivers in the Next Gen era.
Well, active drivers. Technically, Travis Pastrana, with an 11th-place finish in his one start, has the best average finish. But Elliott is tops among all active drivers at 12.48 after the race at Talladega.
So for the comments in this week's power rankings (based on recent performance), we'll take a look at where the driver is on this list (thanks to the database from Racing Insights) of best performance in the Next Gen era (2022-2024). Any driver with fewer than a full season of starts (36) is not counted when I list where these drivers rank in average finish.
1. William Byron (Last Week: 1)
Byron is second in average finish behind his teammate with a 12.87. But he leads in what many would consider the most important category — the Hendrick Motorsports driver has 11 victories in the Next Gen era.
2. Tyler Reddick (LW: 6)
Reddick is 13th among drivers in the Next Gen era, which he opened at Richard Childress Racing before moving to 23XI Racing prior to last season. He has an average finish of 16.15. His six wins tie him for fourth overall.
3. Kyle Larson (LW: 2)
This probably won't surprise many. Larson ranks second in wins in the Next Gen era behind his Hendrick teammate Byron as Larson has nine victories. But he's just eighth overall in average finish at 14.16. Where does Larson top a list? His 32 top-5 finishes are the best. And his 19 stage wins are more than any other driver.
4. Chase Elliott (LW: 3)
As mentioned, Elliott tops the Next Gen era with an average finish of 12.48. He has six wins, tying him for fourth. Elliott does have seven fewer starts than most of his competition because of the races he missed last year.
5. Denny Hamlin (LW: 4)
Like Larson, few would be surprised that Hamlin ranks high in wins, as he is third overall with eight. The Joe Gibbs Racing veteran is seventh in average finish at 14.13.
6. Christopher Bell (LW: 5)
Bell has pretty impressive stats in the Next Gen era. He is fourth in average finish at 13.93. The Joe Gibbs Racing driver is tops in poles with 10 as well as top-10 finishes with 44.
7. Brad Keselowski (LW: NR)
Keselowski is 15th overall in average finish (16.65) in the Next Gen era, which coincides with his era as a team co-owner at RFK Racing. He is one of only five drivers who have started every Next Gen race (82 of them) and has not won (the others are Justin Haley, Corey LaJoie, Todd Gilliland and Harrison Burton).
8. Martin Truex Jr. (LW: 8)
Truex ranks third overall in average finish in the Next Gen era at 13.63. What makes that a really wild stat is he is 11th in top-5s (15) and ninth in top-10s (37). But he's second in top-20s at 63.
9. Ty Gibbs (LW: 7)
Considering he's in just his second full-time Cup season, Gibbs is lowest among these drivers listed here as he is 20th in average finish (18.41) in the Next Gen. The JGR driver still seeks his first Cup victory.
10. Alex Bowman (LW: NR)
Bowman sits just ahead of Keselowski in the Next Gen average finish rankings as he is 14th with a 16.55. He has missed eight races of the Next Gen era because of injury.
On the verge: Ryan Blaney, Chris Buescher, Chase Briscoe, Ross Chastain, Joey Logano, Bubba Wallace

"'Standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona' is one American community's route to revival","TSA Administrator David Pekoske discusses air travel demand, flight disruptions, his experience going through TSA and firearm detections at checkpoints.
Jackson Browne was a rising singer-songwriter in 1972 when he penned one of the most memorable lines in American music history.
""Well I’m standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona / And such a fine sight to see,"" he wrote in the second verse of ""Take It Easy.""
Just about every American of a certain vintage can easily recite a young man's triumphant testimony that follows.
HOW TWO RIVAL TITANS OF ROCK ‘N’ ROLL TURNED A NYC TENEMENT INTO A GLOBAL MUSIC LANDMARK
""It’s a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford / Slowing down to take a look at me.""
Browne described the origin of the song in an interview with the British music site Uncut in 2013.
Winslow, Arizona was immortalized in ""Take It Easy,"" the debut single by the Eagles in 1972. Written by Jackson Browne, it memorably describes a girl ""in a flatbed Ford slowing down to take a look"" at a man ""standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona.""  (Standinonthecorner.org)
""I took a road trip in this old beat-up Willys Jeep and I went to Utah and Arizona. On that trip, I started to write ‘Take It Easy,'"" he said.
""When I came back, I played it for Glenn Frey, and he asked if the Eagles could cut it when it was done … It was their first single, and what those guys did with it was incredible.""
The atmospheric, all-American country-rock anthem, complete with quick-picking background banjo, made the Eagles major stars.
ISRAEL'S FAVORITE COMFORT FOOD, SHAKSHUKA, IS A HOT TASTE TREND RICH IN TRADITION, GLOBAL INFLUENCES
Winslow in the early 1970s was a little city of about 8,500 people made bustling by its location on legendary Route 66.
The Eagles by the end of the decade soared into the pantheon of greatest acts in music history. But the little city that gave their first hit wings was effectively wiped off the map.

Schmit, Don Henley (on drum riser), Jackson Browne, Joe Walsh, and Steuart Smith perform onstage during The 58th Grammy Awards at Staples Center on Feb. 15, 2016 in Los Angeles, California.  (Kevin Winter/WireImage)
Interstate 40 opened in 1979, feeding high-speed traffic north of the city.
""The freeway bypassed us and then basically downtown Winslow died,"" Stephanie Lugo, a board member for the Standing on the Corner Foundation, told Fox News Digital in an interview.
""The freeway bypassed us and then basically downtown Winslow died.""
The same fate befell hundreds of communities along the 2,500 miles of Route 66 that connected Chicago to Los Angeles.
Winslow had something few others had. It had pop-culture immortality, in the image of a young man catching the fancy of a young lady in a truck.
MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INVENTED THE ELECTRIC GUITAR AND INSPIRED ROCK ‘N’ ROLL
Standing on the Corner Park, featuring a life-size statue of a man with a guitar between his feet and, presumably, ""seven women on my mind,"" opened in 1999.

Winslow might have become just another desert ghost town.
Instead, it's a destination for rock fans and selfie seekers from around the world.
Winslow added a second statue in 2016 of Frey, soon after the singer died.
""It’s a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford / Slowing down to take a look at me.""
Lugo said 300 people or more stop for photographs on any single day.
""On holidays and weekends, the crowd is nonstop,"" she said, ""especially in the summer time when kids are out of school.""

The park, she added, ""definitely helped rebuild our downtown. We have several new restaurants and new shops. The downtown has come back to life.""
Browne certainly had no idea his song would ever be heard, let alone help recapture the glory of a small desert town.
Standin' on the Corner Park is a tourist attraction in Winslow, Arizona. The community was made famous by its mention in ""Take It Easy,"" the first hit song for the Eagles in 1972, written by Jackson Browne. (Standin' on the Corner Foundation)
Among other claims to fame, ""Take It Easy"" is the first track on the greatest-selling album of all time.
""Eagles: Their Greatest Hits (1971-75)"" has sold 38 million certified albums, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.
It surpassed Michael Jackson’s ""Thriller"" (34 million) for the No. 1 spot in 2018.

"Driving dangers: 9 top distractions that contribute to accidents, according to experts","Oregon State Police share this video of a car launching 200 feet off an embankment on Feb. 25, 2024.
April is Distracted Driving Awareness Month — a good time to be mindful about potential hazards on the road.
Laura Adams, senior analyst with Aceable, an Austin, Texas-based driver education company, told Fox News Digital that distracted driving poses ""significant risks,"" contributing to about 3,000 deaths per year.
""Understanding the most common driving distractions, adopting proactive measures to avoid them and investing in defensive driving education are crucial steps to create a safer environment for yourself and others on the road,"" she said.
TEEN IS HASSLED BY FRIENDS WHEN HE WON'T DRIVE UNLESS ALL PASSENGERS ARE BUCKLED UP
Tina Paff, a certified driver rehabilitation specialist for Bick’s Driving School of Southwest Ohio, told Fox News Digital that driving distractions tend to fall into one of three main categories: visual, physical or cognitive.
The experts identified nine of the most common distractions on the road.
Distracted driving causes approximately 3,000 deaths per year, according to an expert. Here are some of the most common distracted driving actions on the road today.  (iStock)
Daydreaming is one of the ""most frequent"" and ""scariest"" distractions, Adams warned.
""It can occur during monotonous or long drives, like a daily commute,"" she said.
THESE MEDICATIONS COULD MAKE DRIVING DANGEROUS, THE FDA WARNS
""Maintaining focus on the road and practicing mindfulness while driving can help prevent lapses in attention caused by daydreaming or what you see outside your vehicle,"" she said.
Checking your cell phone while driving is an example of a visual distraction, according to Paff.
""You might take your eyes off the road to read that text, or to look at the GPS, or to adjust music, or for climate control,"" she said.
""They all take your eyes off the road.""
Checking your cell phone while driving is an example of a visual distraction, according to a driving expert. (iStock)
Adams agreed, noting that while answering a text can be a natural impulse, any phone-related activities will divert your attention from the road.
""To avoid distraction, use proactive measures like setting your phone to 'Do Not Disturb' mode and pre-programming any GPS apps before you start driving,"" she advised.
Staying focused on driving means actively scanning your surroundings by watching the road ahead and using your side and rearview mirrors, according to Adams.
""The biggest culprit is the cell phone.""
""Looking at something outside your vehicle for too long, such as a billboard, another car or anything else that might catch your eye can be dangerous,"" she said.
""If you’re not paying attention when a vehicle, cyclist or pedestrian gets in your path, it only takes a couple of seconds for an accident to happen.""
WHEN SHOULD OLDER DRIVERS HAVE TO STOP DRIVING?
Paff categorized these types of distractions as ""cognitive,"" since it’s ""taking our mind off driving.""
Practicing mindfulness while driving can help prevent lapses in attention, she said.
Cognitive distractions such as looking at something outside your car will ""take your mind off driving,"" an expert said. (iStock)
""Think of the times you arrived somewhere and you don’t remember the drive getting there,"" she said.
""The biggest culprit is the cell phone, as we begin to engage in the conversation or text chain more than concentrating on driving.""
Substance abuse, or even the use of some allergy or sleep medications, can ""leave us feeling foggy,"" Paff noted.
5 THINGS YOU SHOULD NOT DO DURING A TRAFFIC STOP
""And we may miss a few very important things along the way, like a stop sign, a light or traffic,"" she said.
Sleep deprivation can also cause fogginess, taking one's attention away from the road, Paff added.
Sleep deprivation can be dangerous for drivers, experts warn. (iStock)
""If you know you are driving in the morning, maybe start limiting that medication you take at night that can and will affect your driving,"" she said.
""If you suffer from sleep deprivation and you have no choice, you may want to leave your house with an energy or caffeinated drink.""
MEAT PIE, SPIDERS AND A TOUPEE: UBER DISHES ON WEIRD THINGS LEFT BEHIND IN RIDES THIS YEAR
People who are sleep-deprived shouldn’t keep their car ""all heated and cozy,"" Paff said. ""Go ahead and open the window [and] get that cool air blowing through to keep you alert and responsive.""
Tasks like reaching for a fallen object, answering a text or chatting with a passenger can all come as ""natural impulses,"" Adams said.
""Reaching for a fallen object while driving can only take a matter of seconds, but those seconds could be the difference between staying safe and causing an accident,"" she noted.
Make sure you have all your supplies in place before starting to drive, an expert advised. (iStock)
""Before driving, consider what you may need and place it close to you. If you need an object that would take your attention away from driving, pull off the road and stop your vehicle in a safe place to retrieve it.""
Establishing clear rules for passengers is a must, especially for new drivers who are still getting comfortable with the road, Adams said.
""If you have passengers, tell them you must stay focused on the road to drive safely,"" she suggested. ""To keep them engaged while maintaining safety, you could ask them to help you navigate the best route to your destination.""
Instead of trying to multitask while driving, Adams said it's best to finish eating and drinking before driving.
""Managing messy foods or spills could be a significant distraction behind the wheel or cause you to lose control of your vehicle,"" she warned.
Eating and drinking while driving is one of the primary causes of distracted driving, experts agreed. (iStock)
""Phones can cause us to stop physically driving, but so can eating, drinking [and] grooming,"" Paff added.
To ensure that your hands stay on the steering wheel, it's important to have all your supplies in place before you start driving, said Paff.
Adams agreed, suggesting pre-adjusting all onboard systems, like climate control, mapping, music, seats and mirrors.
""Stay focused on the destination, be alert to others around you, turn phone notifications off and enjoy the ride.""
""Trying to make changes while driving can be a dangerous distraction and prevents you from physically making changes while driving,"" she said.
""Always secure your children, pets or anything in your vehicle that could move before getting underway,"" Adams advised.
""If they need your attention, pull off the road to manage them safely instead of trying to reach the backseat while driving.""

Even vigilant drivers are at risk when other drivers are distracted, Adams warned. To help reduce this risk, she suggested taking a defensive driving class.
""They teach valuable tools and strategies to anticipate and respond to hazardous situations, including those caused by distracted drivers,"" she said.
Drivers should ""stay focused on the destination, be alert of others around you, turn phone notifications off and enjoy the ride,"" an expert advised. (Arterra/Universal Images Group)
""By learning defensive driving techniques, you can enhance your awareness of potential risks, improve your decision-making skills and reduce the likelihood of being involved in a distracted driving accident.""
Another technique that Paff offered is envisioning arriving safely at your destination while driving.

An unusual drama is going viral on Reddit as a young man sought advice after friends gave him grief for insisting they fasten their seat belts in the car before he started driving — and over 6,000 people have already reacted to the post.
""Last night, I was getting off work at 11:30 p.m.,"" wrote the young man, describing himself as 18 years old.
""My two other friends were also leaving as well and asked me if they could get a ride,"" he wrote on Reddit, describing the two friends as 18-year-old males.

The young man went on, ""It [was] a pretty chilly night at about 40 degrees and only a few cars are out and about. We all packed into my [car] … I waited to hear all of their seatbelts (sic) click, which never came,"" he added.

The young man added, ""After a solid minute, one of them broke the silence and asked, 'Wait, you're serious?' and … I said ‘Yeah.’""
""I said the obvious reasons: safety and I don't want [any] tickets if we happen to get pulled over.""

Thousands protest in Argentina as Milei's austerity plan hits universities,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei has tried to dismiss the worsening budget crisis at public universities as politics as usual, a contest with his leftist political rivals who hold sway over liberal campuses.
It does not feel that way to many of the students at the elite University of Buenos Aires, where halls went dark, elevators froze and air conditioning stopped working in some buildings last week. Professors taught 200-person lectures without microphones or projectors because the public university — among the best in Latin America — couldn't cover its electricity bill.
""This is an unthinkable crisis,"" said Valeria Añón, a 50-year-old literature professor protesting Milei's austerity measures in downtown Buenos Aires with thousands of others on Tuesday. ""I feel so sad for my students and for myself.""
JAVIER MILEI CRUSHES ARGENTINE LEFT, BECOMES WORLD'S FIRST LIBERTARIAN HEAD OF STATE
In his drive to reach zero deficit, Milei is slashing spending across Argentina — shuttering ministries, defunding cultural centers, laying off state workers and cutting subsidies. On Monday he had something to show for it, announcing Argentina’s first quarterly fiscal surplus since 2008.

The posters read in Spanish ""With fascism, there are no rights,"" center, and ""Why so much fear to educate the people?,"" right, and ""Defending the university is defending the country,"" left.  (AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko)
""We are making possible the impossible even with the majority of politics, unions, the media and most economic actors against us,"" he said in a televised address.
Crowds of university students and professors walked out of class Tuesday in a massive display of defiance, joining thousands of demonstrators streaming into the city center. Some privately financed schools closed in solidarity. Protests also gripped other cities in Argentina. ""The university will defend itself!"" students shouted.
""We are trying to show the government it cannot take away our right to education,"" said Santiago Ciraolo, a 32-year-old student in social communication protesting Tuesday. ""Everything is at stake here.""
In a sign of the larger ideological battle at play, members of trade unions and left-wing parties also filled the streets. Describing universities as bastions of socialism where professors indoctrinate their students, Milei has accused his political enemies of fomenting discontent. ""The cognitive dissonance that brainwashing generates in public education is tremendous,"" he said.
Since last July, when the fiscal year began, the 200-year-old University of Buenos Aires, or UBA, has received just 8.9% of its total budget from the state as annual inflation now hovers near 290%. The university says that's barely enough to keep lights on and provide basic services in teaching hospitals that have already cut capacity.
Declaring a financial emergency, UBA warned last week that without a rescue plan, the school would shut down in the coming months, stranding 380,000 students mid-degree. It's a shock for Argentines who consider a free and quality university education a national birthright. UBA has a proud intellectual tradition, having produced five Nobel Prize winners and 17 presidents.
""I've been given access to a future, to opportunities through this university that otherwise my family and many others at our income level could never afford,"" said Alex Vargas, a 24-year-old economics student. ""When you step back, you see how important this is for our society.""
President Milei came to power last December, inheriting an economy in shambles after years of chronic overspending and suffocating international debt. Brandishing a chainsaw during his campaign to symbolize slashing the budget, he repeats a simple catchphrase to compatriots reeling budget cuts and the peso’s 50% devaluation: ""There is no money.""
Overall, Argentina puts about 4.6% of its gross domestic product into education. Critics of the university system say the budget cuts also are an attempt to raise efficiency and increase fiscal transparency. Some want foreign students to start paying dues. Public universities are free not only for Argentines but also for international pupils, drawing legions of students from across Latin America, Spain and further afield.
""Where I'm from, high-quality education is unfortunately a privilege, not a basic right,"" said Sofia Hernandez, a 21-year-old from Bogota, Colombia studying medicine at UBA. ""In Argentina there is a model that I wish more countries could have.""
The government said late Monday it was sending some $24.5 million to public universities and another $12 million to keep medical centers operating. ""The discussion is closed and settled,"" presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni said Tuesday.
University authorities disagreed, saying the promised transfer — which they still have not received — covers just a fraction of what they need. For UBA, that means a 61% annual budget cut, when accounting for inflation.
It also won't help the income of teachers who have seen their salary decline in value more than 35% in the past four months, said Matías Ruiz, UBA's treasury secretary. Staff salaries can be as low as $150 a month. Many teachers juggle multiple jobs just to scrape by, and they wonder if they'll get any salary all next month.
""This has a major impact on our research, on the projects and academic activities we're able to do,"" said Ines Aldao, a 44-year-old literature professor at UBA. ""We've had funding and salary freezes under previous right-wing governments but these cuts are three times worse.""

The new equipment includes a revamped scanner system to allow a more detailed scan of passengers’ baggage, so that travelers won’t have to remove items such as electronic devices, aerosols or liquids from their bags.

"Morocco wants to become an aviation hub, but airplane makers struggle to meet demand","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Moroccan officials want to turn the country into an aviation hub, luring investors aiming to spread out their supply chains to more nations with available and affordable workers.
The North African kingdom is among a longer list of countries vying for contracts with big manufacturers looking to speed up production and deliver more planes to meet demand. Companies like Boeing and Airbus — as well as the manufacturers that build their components — are outsourcing design, production and maintenance to countries from Mexico to Thailand.
MOROCCAN AUTHORITIES PLAN NEW LAWS TO COMBAT ART FORGERIES IN GROWING MARKET
In Morocco, efforts to grow the country's $2 billion-a-year aerospace industry are part of a years-long push to transform the largely agrarian economy through subsidizing manufacturers of planes, trains and automobiles. Officials hope it dovetails with efforts to grow Moroccan airlines, including the state-owned Royal Air Maroc.
""The needs are huge and we are in a very good position,"" said Hamid Abbou, the airline's CEO. ""Most of the big suppliers in Europe are struggling to get people to work in this industry. We don’t have that issue.""

Despite hopes among its cheerleaders, the air travel industry faces headwinds. When demand rebounded after much air traffic stopped during the pandemic, manufacturers faced challenges building enough planes to meet demand from airlines. For Boeing, delays caused by supply chain issues were compounded by high-profile emergencies and deadly crashes that further curtailed deliveries.
From eastern Europe to southeast Asia, new levels of demand have forced manufacturers to seek out new locations to build and repair parts.
Safran Aircraft Engines, a French manufacturer, sends engines for Boeing 737s and Airbus 320s to a repair plant outside of Casablanca every six to eight years and then sends them back to airlines from countries including Brazil, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Ireland.
The company is among 130 in the sector active in Morocco, where parts ranging from wings to fuselages are produced in an industry that employs 42% women — a proportion that industry lobbyists say is larger than its European and North American manufacturing industry counterparts.
Though many companies eye Morocco as a source for comparatively cheap labor, the industry and government have worked to train skilled workers at IMA, an institute for aeronautics professions in Casablanca.

At an event celebrating Safran's 25-year partnership with Royal Air Maroc, Safran CEO Jean-Paul Alary said he hoped Morocco's aviation industry would continue to expand, particularly as industrywide demand increases and companies face labor shortages in Europe.

Hospital begs for snakebite victims to stop bringing in serpents when seeking help: 'Puts the staff at risk',"Five tammar wallaby joeys were seen hanging out in their new habitat at the Perth Zoo in Australia. Originally orphaned and found on Garden Island, the group is now being carefully watched by zoo staff. See them thrive!
An Australian hospital urged snakebite victims to stop trying to catch the slithery culprits when seeking medical attention after one patient came in carrying a serpent in a loosely locked box.
""We honestly don't want people interacting with snakes any more than they already have,"" Dr. Adam Michael, director of emergency medicine at Bundaberg Hospital near Brisbane, told the Australian Broadcast Company. ""Any attempts to either get close to a snake to catch or to kill, or to photograph the snake, just puts people at risk.""
About 3,000 people suffer suspected snakebites each year in Australia, according to the National Institutes of Health. Only between 100 and 200 cases end up requiring anti-venom.

Michael related how one victim brought an eastern brown snake with them, carrying the serpent in a plastic food container that was ""not very well secured."" The snake tried to get out, which ended up frightening hospital staff.

He also cited examples of patients bringing in snakes contained in plastic bags and even less-secured plastic containers. The hospital then had to pay for the snakes to be relocated to the wild.

""We want people to be able to get seen and assessed quickly and having a live snake in the department slows up that process,"" Michael said, assuring that doctors do not need to see and identify the snake in order to treat poisonous bites.

""We can determine if you need anti-venom and if so, what anti-venom you need based on clinical signs, blood tests and also the snake venom detection kits that we keep here at the hospital,"" Michael stressed. ""We're actually not trained to identify snakes, and so it's not helpful. It just puts the staff at risk as well as yourself.""

Instead, Michael asked patients to focus on their wound and receiving treatment: Stay calm, avoid cleaning the affected area and apply firm pressure while seeking medical attention as soon as possible, according to The Guardian.

The Wide Bay Hospital & Health Service, which oversees operations of the Bundaberg Hospital, posted further guidelines on Facebook: Avoid washing the area, firmly bandage it, immobilize the limb to slow the spread of venom, mark the bandage to show where the bite is and continue to hold pressure – tight enough to slow the spread but not enough to cut off circulation.

""Applying a tourniquet, cutting the wound, sucking the venom or bringing the snake with you to emergency are not recommended,"" the post warned. ""We understand that being bitten by a snake is scary, but all facilities across our health service hold stocks of polyvalent and are well-prepared to treat snake bites.""

Barry Manilow did not think 'Copacabana' would be a hit,"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.
Barry Manilow recalled how he initially didn't think one of his most iconic songs would be a hit.
During an interview with NBC News, the 80-year-old singer explained that he ""never"" knows when a song he creates will become a success.
""I just write them. And if I'm lucky, I make a great record out of it. And that's it. That's all I know,"" Manilow said.

""'Copacabana,'"" Manilow admitted of the 1978 classic that he co-wrote with lyricists Bruce Sussman and Jack Feldman.
He continued, ""It was fun to write it. It was fun to make a great record of it. And, that was it.""
Manilow remembered that he and his co-producer at the time, Ron Dante, doubted that the song would even get airplay.
""It sounded really great, but it was a novelty card,"" he remembered. ""Nobody was making songs like that. We never thought it would ever get played on the radio.
""But we took it to a disco, when there were discos and, we asked the DJ to play it,"" Manilow continued. ""And everybody ran to the dance floor and started to dance like they were back in the 1940s. They were dipping the girls and all because, you know, it's ‘Copa.’ And, I said to Ron, we may be onto something with this one.
""And then, it turned out to be the most popular song in my catalog.""
The song won Manilow his first and only Grammy Award. ( Arturo Holmes/Getty Images)
Inspired by the legendary New York nightclub Copacabana, the song was featured on Manilow's fifth studio album ""Even Now."" ""Copacabana"" became the first certified gold single that Manilow wrote or co-wrote and reached No. 8 on the U.S. Billboard Charts.
Manilow received his first and only Grammy Award for ""Copacabana,"" winning him the trophy for best male pop vocal performance in 1979.

Due to ""Copacabana's"" success, Manilow, Sussman and Feldman produced the 1985 musical TV movie of the same name based on the song's story and lyrics with additional musical numbers. The trio later created a stage musical titled ""Copacabana,"" which debuted at London's West End and ran for two years.
""Copacabana"" went on to tour the United Kingdom for 18 months, and more than 100 productions of the musical have been staged around the world.

Megan Thee Stallion sued by former cameraman after rapper allegedly had sex in front of him: lawsuit,"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.
Megan Thee Stallion was sued by a former employee who accused the rapper of creating an unbearable hostile work environment and subjecting him to sexual harassment, in documents obtained by Fox News Digital.

The following day, Stallion allegedly asked Garcia if he was in the SUV the previous night. Once he confirmed, Stallion instructed Garcia, ""Don't ever discuss what you saw,"" according to court documents.

"Israel's favorite comfort food, shakshuka, is a hot taste trend rich in tradition, global influences","Removing things that constrict our lives
Shakshuka performs a rare dual feat of flavor.
The savory tomato stew, typically made with aromatic herbs and eggs, is steeped in Israeli tradition. Yet it boasts global culinary currency as a hot food trend from the Middle East to Middle America.
Shakshuka recipes are passed down through generations and often served on holidays, such as Passover, which begins on Monday, April 22, at dusk.
PASSOVER HOLD THE KEY TO COMPREHENDING TODAY'S ‘VICIOUS’ ANTISEMITISM, SAYS RABBI AND SPIRITUAL LEADER
Yet it's also served by celebrated chefs or found on buzzy internet lists for trend-setting ""in the know"" foodies.
""Shakshuka is at the heart of Israeli culture,"" chef Avi Shemtov, the Israeli-American chef-owner of Simcha in Sharon, Massachusetts, told Fox News Digital.

""It’s a dish that every home makes a little differently and everyone desperately wants to show off and share.""
More importantly, said Shemtov, ""just like any food from the Jewish culture, it shows our global journey and where we’ve come from.""
""Shakshuka was born in Ottoman North Africa in the mid-16th century,"" author Joan Nathan wrote in the 2017 book, ""King Solomon's Table: A Culinary Exploration of Jewish Cooking from Around The World.""

""Its name comes from an Arabic and Hebrew word meaning ‘all mixed up.’""
Shakshuka, in other words, is of Arab and Islamic origin, which makes it quite typical of food in Israel.
Though the world's only Jewish state, Israel boasts one of the world's most diverse populations.

More than 20% of Israel's 9.4 million residents are Arab.
About 72% are Jewish, but more than half of them are Sephardic: non-European Jews of Turkish, Persian, Arab and African descent, according to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics.
As a result, its food is among the most diverse in the world, too.
""Shakshuka is at the heart of Israeli culture.""
The foundation of the shakshuka is even more far-flung than North Africa or the Arab world. It comes all the way from the Western Hemisphere.
Tomatoes are native to the New World. They arrived in the Old World – Africa, Asia, Europe – only after Columbus’s voyages first landed in the Americas in 1492.
Shakshuka today is enjoying a moment of stardom in both Old and New Worlds.

"Perfect pie crust today includes lard, which has returned to glory after years of bad publicity","Co-founder of Truemed Calley Means joins ‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ to discuss the health benefits of eating real meat versus plant-based, calling it ‘toxic sludge.’
Lard was the canary in the coal mine of culinary correctness.
Rendered pig fat was ubiquitous in human diets for centuries. It was used to fry everything from dough to chicken and was an essential ingredient in pie making.
Lard tragically fell from public favor during the Great War on Monounsaturated Fats in the 20th century.
AMERICAN DINER LINGO EXISTED PATRIOTIC ERA WHEN ‘BURN THE BRITISH!’ MEANT TOASTED ENGLISH MUFFIN
Progressive trans-fats activists launched a bombardment of bad publicity against animal fats starting in the 1950s, often culled from inaccurate sources.
Everybody loved lard in the 1960s —  yet by the 1980s, nobody dared mention it.
Lard is one of the essential ingredients in the crust made by Little Pie Co. of New York City, a celebrated bakery in Midtown Manhattan. (Courtesy Little Pie Co.)
Humanity's staple foodstuffs were soon caught in the crossfire: Salt, sugar, eggs, butter and wheat were all savaged as unhealthy over the years.
But the times they are a changin'.
Lard has enjoyed a rebirth in recent years thanks largely to a heroic band of pig-fat patriots who withstood the bad-news blitzkrieg.
AMERICAN CULTURE QUIZ: HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW ‘MODERN FAMILY,’ THE MODERN MILITARY AND MORE?
Pie makers and pastry chefs never surrendered their right to keep and bear lard.
""The main reason we use lard is because of the flakiness that it gives to our pie crust,"" Arnold Wilkerson, the owner of Little Pie Co. in New York City, told Fox News Digital.

Lard, an all-natural product, was often replaced by trans fats — many of which are manmade.
""Trans fat clogs arteries, increasing the risk of heart attacks and deaths,"" according to the World Health Organization, adding that ""trans fat can be found in margarine, vegetable shortening .... and baked goods such as crackers, biscuits and pies.""
(Crisco, by the way, notes on its website, ""All Crisco shortening products now have 0g trans fat per serving for a more healthful option."")
Moderation remains the best advice, according to nutritionists.
Lard laughed in the face of culinary cancel culture and kale in 2020, when it landed at No. 8 (eight!) on the list of 100 of ""the world's most nutritious foods"" published by the BBC.

American diner lingo existed in patriotic era when 'Burn the British!' meant toasted English muffin,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The taste of revenge was served in American diners for decades.
The British burned Falmouth, Maine in 1775; Fairfield, Connecticut in 1779; and Washington, D.C. in 1814.
Hungry Americans returned the favor for decades every time they ordered breakfast.
TAMALES ARE HOT TODAY, YET SAVORY WRAPS ARE AS OLD AS CIVILIZATION
""Burn the British!"" was a popular outcry from waiters to cooks in a largely forgotten uniquely American culinary vernacular. That would be diner lingo.
""'Burn the British' meant toasted English muffins,"" recalled David Steinmann, who was born in Brooklyn in the 1940s and today is chairman of the Jewish Institute for the National Security of America (JINSA).
""Gimme a pair looking at ya and burn the British"" is how diner employees might have described sunny-side-up eggs and English muffins in the glory days of diner lingo, a popular American vernacular in the mid-20th century.  (Dorling Kindersley ltd/Alamy Stock Photo )
The phrase and many others are remembered by diner-lingologists today as six U.S. states celebrate Patriots' Day.
It's held on the third Monday of April in honor of the anniversary of the start of the American Revolution on April 19, 1775.
""The lighthearted, tongue-in-cheek and even sometimes risqué phrases could be heard in wide use in busy diners during the 1920s continuing on well into the 1970s,"" Garrison Leykam, author of ""Classic Diners of Connecticut,"" wrote for Connecticut Magazine (CTInsider.com).
""The lighthearted, tongue-in-cheek and even sometimes risqué phrases could be heard in wide use in busy diners.""
The slang shouted in diners wasn’t shorthand. In many cases, its phrases were longer than the actual words they replaced.
The terminology instead was peppered with salty language, seasoned with political incorrectness and often served with a double order of entendre.
Especially popular for those who want to grab a quick bite and run errands are the eateries in the Washington Market area. Standing room only was the rule — there were no seats. (Bettmann/CORBIS/Bettmann Archive)
""Every diner had the counter man and the cooks,"" said Steinmann, who as a boy in New York City in the 1950s ate each Saturday with his family at their local diner in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn.
""If you ordered eggs sunny-side-up, the counter man yelled out, ‘Give me a pair looking at ya.' You wanted them over easy, he'd yell, ‘Give me a pair and blind ‘em.'""

Among the highlights he listed:

Blonde with sand - coffee with cream and sugar

The colorful language heard in diners largely faded out by the 1970s.
Several common American culinary idioms, however, still trace their roots to the phenomenon: blue-plate special, BLT (bacon lettuce, tomato sandwich) and java (coffee) among them.

Songwriters Walter Becker and Donald Fagen grew up among the diner culture of New York and New Jersey. The song title is likely a reference to diner slang.

"Tamales are hot today, yet savory wraps are as old as civilization","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Tamales are one of the hottest topics in the American food scene — proving that food-on-the-run paired with great flavor never goes out of style.
Social conversations about tamales exploded 47% over the past year, according to Tastewise, a new platform that uses artificial intelligence to find food trends by tracking social media, restaurant menus and digital content.
The platform found that about 34,000 eateries in the United States serve tamales: a corn dough wrap called masa, filled with any of an array of meats, vegetables and spices, then steamed inside corn husks or banana leaves.

Tornado Alley to roar back to life as dangerous stretch of severe storms on the way,"A potent storm system will kick off strong to severe thunderstorms on Thursday across the Plains.
After a relatively calm period of severe weather at the end of last week and the beginning of this one, Tornado Alley is poised to come back to life with a multiday severe weather event starting Thursday and continuing through the weekend.
Multiple disturbances will emerge from the Rockies and bring dangerous rounds of severe storms to the Plains and Mississippi Valley, which is typical as severe weather often peaks in these areas from late April through May.
A few strong to severe storms capable of producing large hail and strong wind gusts will form along a dryline on Wednesday in parts of West Texas and Oklahoma, but these will merely serve as an appetizer to the main event, which begins Thursday.
HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER
The southern and central Plains appear to be the target Thursday, and NOAA’s Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has placed that region in a Level 3 out of 5 risk on its 5-point severe thunderstorm risk scale.
The setup on Thursday, however, is different from previous severe weather outbreaks last week.
The FOX Forecast Center said an upper-level disturbance will move into the Southwest by early Thursday. As that piece of energy approaches the central U.S., an area of low pressure will form at the surface and fuel the development of rain and thunderstorms.
Thursday’s severe weather threat extends from south-central Nebraska through central Kansas, western and central Oklahoma and northwestern Texas.
Wichita in Kansas, Oklahoma City and Norman in Oklahoma and Lubbock and Wichita Falls in Texas all face the risk of severe weather on Thursday.
The SPC said a few supercell thunderstorms could develop and will be capable of producing large hail, damaging wind gusts and even a few tornadoes.
NEW SUMMER WEATHER OUTLOOK LOOKS TOASTY ACROSS MUCH OF US AS JUNE LOOMS LESS THAN 50 DAYS AWAY
The severe weather threat will then pivot to the eastern Great Plains and the mid-Mississippi Valley by Friday and will expand in coverage.
Eight states from Texas to Iowa will be in a Level 2 out of 5 risk, which includes major cities like Dallas and Waco in Texas, Oklahoma City and Tulsa in Oklahoma, Kansas City and Springfield in Missouri and Des Moines in Iowa.
Large hail and damaging wind gusts will be some of the threats associated with thunderstorms that develop. However, the threat of tornadoes may be a bit higher than what is expected on Thursday.
WHAT DOES RAIN SMELL LIKE?
The severe weather threat will again target the southern and central Plains and the mid-Mississippi Valley on Saturday, with portions of North Texas, most of Oklahoma, central and eastern Kansas and western and northern Missouri seeing the highest risk of storms for the first part of the weekend.
The SPC said that daytime heating will allow for storms to develop, and those storms could continue as we get into Saturday evening.
A storm system is predicted to move from the central Plains toward the Great Lakes region on Sunday, bringing a risk of severe thunderstorms from the Ark-La-Tex region to parts of the Midwest.
Changes are expected with the forecast, however, as computer forecast models continue to analyze data. Be sure to download the free FOX Weather app and enable notifications to receive important weather alerts and monitor changes to the forecast.
A look at the average tornadoes per month from 1991-2020.
(FOX Weather)
April's tornadic activity has been above average with 184 reports this month.
May is typically the most active month for tornadoes with an average of 294 twisters, according to the latest historical data from the SPC.
In 2024, the center has received 347 reports of tornadoes, which is more than 10% fewer than an average year to date.
""This past week really solidified us with above-average activity,"" FOX Weather Meteorologist Jane Minar said. ""And when you take a look at the month of April, where you typically see tornadic threats, it's more back off through the Plains. So you look into, say, Texas, portions of Oklahoma, even into parts of the Southeast, the Mississippi River region, but we've been seeing much more activity, you know, up across the Ohio Valley. Ohio leads the country with the number of tornadoes.""

The month of April has brought a significant amount of rain so far. Numerous cities in the Northeast have reported rainfall on at least half of the days.
""Then we factor in just kind of the cool and unsettled weather altogether, just not the best situation as we head into the middle of the month,"" FOX Weather Meteorologist Kendall Smith said.
Pittsburgh has experienced rain on 12 out of the first 17 days of the month, the most of any city in the region. Rainfall totals have been significant, with amounts ranging from 2 to 6 inches above the average by this point in April.
Rain will remain in the forecast, with showers expected to fall in parts of the region on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and again next week. The rain will not be especially heavy, but just enough of a nuisance for a region already very much over this year's April showers.
On the temperature front, the 60s, 70s and 80s experienced Monday and Tuesday will be a distant memory as temperatures will drop back to near or below average starting Thursday. Highs will remain in the 40s, 50s and lower 60s.

April's full Moon, known as the Pink Moon, rises on Tuesday night and will appear bright in the night sky through the end of the week.
The Moon will rise at 7:49 p.m. ET Tuesday for those on the U.S. East Coast. Those in the West will have to wait a few hours to see the full Moon light up the night sky, which rises around 4:48 p.m. PT on the Pacific Coast.
This Moon is known by many names, according to different Native American tribes and cultures worldwide. The Maine Farmers' Almanac started using the Native American names for full Moons in the 1930s.
According to the Farmers' Almanac, the Pink Moon is named for the herb moss pink, also known as creeping phlox, a plant native to the eastern U.S. This bloom is pink and can be a sign of spring.

April's full Moon has other native names, including the Egg Moon, Fish Moon and Sprouting Grass Moon. According to the Hebrew calendar, it's also known as the Passover or Pesach Moon.

Those in the Northeast, Southern California and the South may have difficulty getting a good view on Tuesday night, with a 50% or more cloud coverage forecast. A cold front that moved through the Great Lakes on Monday is pushing into the Northeast on Tuesday, bringing more rain and cloud cover.
However, skies should be relatively clear for those in the Great Lakes, Upper Plains, Southwest and Southeast.

Tornado strikes Missouri event venue during wedding rehearsal,"They say rain on your wedding day is good luck, but what about a tornado? Brookdale Farms General Manager James Vavak joined FOX Weather on Tuesday to talk about an EF-1 tornado that tore through the venue during a wedding rehearsal in Eureka, Missouri.
EUREKA, Mo. – A Missouri tornado almost delayed a couple's wedding when the EF-1 twister ripped the roof off their event venue, but in less than 48 hours, the Brookdale Farms team scrambled to make it happen as planned.
The tornado hit on Thursday evening while the rehearsal was ongoing, with about 20 people in the building at Brookdale Farms in Eureka, Missouri, just outside St. Louis.
""My wedding coordinators really jumped into action when they saw the glass garage doors starting to bow in, and they got everyone to safety in time before a portion of the roof was ripped off,"" Brookdale Farms General Manager James Vavak said.

Another building on the property also suffered significant damage during the twister.
A portion of the event venue roof came off during the tornado, and one of the back doors was ripped out, but thankfully, no one was injured. However, the building was deemed unsafe, and the wedding was planned for Saturday evening, less than 48 hours away.

According to the National Weather Service in St. Louis, the April 16 EF-1 tornado caused the worst damage along Twin Rivers Road, where the venue is located.
Vavak said when he returned to the farm after the tornado, he immediately comforted the couple.
""She was keeping it together a lot better than I think a lot of brides would, but I knew on the inside she was panicked,"" Vavak said. ""She'd been working on planning the special day for about two years, and all of a sudden, all of your planning has been thrown out the window, literally.""

Construction crews arrived at 7 a.m. Friday, and the final piece of the roof went up by 2:30 p.m. A county inspector arrived Saturday morning and gave Brookdale Farms a temporary permit, allowing the wedding to happen Saturday at 5 p.m.

"North Carolina lawmakers reconvene to address budget, vouchers before key elections","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The North Carolina General Assembly begins its annual work session Wednesday with a little extra money to spend and limited pressing issues to address before key elections this fall and longtime state government leaders depart.
Following their landmark 2023 session that expanded Medicaid, restricted abortion, broadened gun rights, swelled private-school vouchers and weakened the governor, Republicans leading the House and Senate are talking about the traditionally ""short"" session to be just that — with a goal to finish by early summer.
NORTH CAROLINA GOV. COOPER VETOES 2 MORE BILLS, BUT BUDGET STILL ON TRACK TO BECOME LAW TUESDAY
""We dealt with a lot of weighty issues,"" House Speaker Tim Moore, a Cleveland County Republican, told reporters recently. ""Are there still some things left to be done? Yes, we’re going to deal with those.""
With all 170 legislative seats up for reelection in November and Republicans who approved last year's agenda holding the narrowest of veto-proof majorities, party leaders will be careful to advance measures that won't sway public opinion against their candidates in key districts. Legislation forcing local sheriffs to assist with federal immigration enforcement and locating more funds for the private-school scholarships could qualify.
The legislature's chief duty in even-numbered years is to adjust the second year of the two-year government operating budget that's already enacted.

A consensus forecast by the legislature and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's administration says the state will collect an additional $1.4 billion through mid-2025 than previously anticipated. This compares to the $30.9 billion currently set to be spent in the fiscal year starting July 1.
As much as $400 million could be needed to make Medicaid spending adjustments because of a lower federal government match and the higher use of services by enrollees, Rep. Donny Lambeth of Forsyth County, a House budget writer, said this week.
And Moore and Senate Majority Leader Paul Newton said separately that GOP colleagues are prepared to set aside more money for the Opportunity Scholarship Program so that more families in higher-income brackets can receive grants this fall for their K-12 children to attend private or religious schools.
The current budget law did away with the program's income caps to qualify, leading to a six-fold increase in applications this year.
But the state authority running the program said there isn't enough to assist all qualifying applicants, and no aid would go to groups of applicants with the highest incomes. It wasn't clear whether Republicans would seek to fully fund the scholarships for the coming year, which Moore said could require $300 million more.
Still, ""I think there’s a high probability that we’re going to make sure the parents who want choice get choice for their children,"" said Newton, a Cabarrus County Republican.
Cooper, who is term-limited from running for reelection, also will present his last budget proposal Wednesday. Cooper is hoping GOP legislators will listen to his calls to stop spending on the Opportunity Scholarship program that he's opposed for years until public schools are ""fully funded,"" and for teachers to receive sizeable pay raises.
""We need to invest in public schools,"" Cooper told reporters recently. ""We know that to sustain the workforce of the future for all these jobs we’re attracting, we’ve got to make sure that our public schools are strong.""
On immigration, Newton said he suspects the Senate would take up a bill approved by the House last year that would force sheriffs to help federal agents interested in picking up jail inmates they believe are in the country illegally. Cooper successfully vetoed similar measures in 2019 and 2022, but that's when GOP legislators lacked supermajorities.
State budget approval was nearly derailed last year when Senate Republicans sought to insert language that would have permitted construction of four more casinos in the state and the sanctioning and regulating video gambling machines statewide. But Republicans from both chambers have suggested discussions about sanctioning the gambling machines could resurface.
General Assembly staff estimated last year that revenue from the machines could generate over $400 million annually by later this decade. That could help make up for revenue losses now projected as approved individual and corporate income tax rates further decline. Republicans have downplayed talk of long-term shortfalls as hasty.
Democratic legislators seeking to halt what they consider bad GOP bills will face the same challenges that began last April when Rep. Tricia Cotham changed her registration to the Republican Party. Her switch secured the veto-proof majority in both chambers. All of Cooper's vetoes last year were overridden.

"EU unable to determine impact of refugee funds given to Turkey, auditors say","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
European Union auditors said on Wednesday that they are unable to establish whether some of the billions of euros the bloc has given to Turkey to help it cope with Syrian refugees is actually having any impact.
Under a deal concluded between EU leaders and Turkey in 2016, the bloc committed to provide at least $6.4 billion to Turkey to help it cope with migrants crossing in from Syria. Turkey in turn committed to stop migrants leaving its territory for Europe.
16 DEAD, INCLUDING 4 CHILDREN, AFTER MIGRANT BOAT SINKS OFF THE COAST OF TURKEY
In March 2016, a month after the deal came into effect, Turkey’s government said the number of migrants crossing illegally into Greece had dropped from around 6,000 per day in November 2015 to about 130 daily.
In 2021, the leaders announced plans to send a further $3.2 billion for refugees in Turkey. The pact, which was hailed in Europe as a great success, served as a template for other more recent and elaborate deals with Tunisia and Egypt.

Money from the agreement is used to supply cash cards to some of the more than 4 million registered refugees, as well as to improve education and health, help people to better integrate and to build facilities in Turkey that people fleeing the war in Syria might need.
But the European Court of Auditors, or ECA, in a follow-up last year on whether the money was being used effectively, said that Turkey’s education ministry had refused to provide information that might allow them to assess what impact EU projects are having.
""I’m quite sure that European citizens would like to see some results coming out of the various development and humanitarian projects that the EU is funding,"" ECA member Bettina Jakobsen told reporters.
According to the European Commission, the bloc's executive branch, at least $566 million was destined to ""support quality inclusive education of refugees in Turkey."" It's meant to pay teacher salaries and provide education equipment, Turkish language and teacher training, as well as counselling and other guidance.
Auditors sought a list of the schools receiving EU support and the number of refugee pupils who are attending, as well as information on whether children who were not in education had been reintegrated into the school system and their exam pass rates, compared to Turkish students.
Without the data, Jakobsen underlined, ""we are not able to conclude on measuring impact or sustainability"" of the education projects underwritten by the EU.
Asked by The Associated Press what was preventing the auditors from getting the information from the education ministry, one EU auditor involved in the process said: ""They just claimed that they didn’t have the data.""
""We do know that data should normally exist,"" said the auditor, who under ECA regulations could not be named. ""It’s not up to us to guess why or why not they don’t want to provide the data.""
An ECA official noted that it is relatively rare for authorities to fail to cooperate with auditors.
The auditors and officials from the commission, which is responsible for ensuring that the bloc’s money is correctly spent, made joint and individual requests for the information, but without success.
The auditors were able to visit some schools, as well as hospitals, which benefit from EU funds and could see that the facilities were used by refugees and Turkish pupils and that teachers were working there.

In general, given the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic, a major earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria in February 2023, and Turkey's rampant inflation, the auditors found that the EU funding package ""provided relevant support to refugees and host communities"" in Turkey.
But Jakobsen also noted that auditors ""found weaknesses in the commission’s assessment of project budgets"" and said the EU’s executive branch ""did not systematically assess whether project costs were reasonable or compare similar costs between different projects.""","Fox News' ""Antisemitism Exposed"" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/eu-unable-determine-impact-refugee-funds-given-turkey-auditors-say,E
Thousands protest in Argentina as Milei's austerity plan hits universities,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei has tried to dismiss the worsening budget crisis at public universities as politics as usual, a contest with his leftist political rivals who hold sway over liberal campuses.
It does not feel that way to many of the students at the elite University of Buenos Aires, where halls went dark, elevators froze and air conditioning stopped working in some buildings last week. Professors taught 200-person lectures without microphones or projectors because the public university — among the best in Latin America — couldn't cover its electricity bill.
""This is an unthinkable crisis,"" said Valeria Añón, a 50-year-old literature professor protesting Milei's austerity measures in downtown Buenos Aires with thousands of others on Tuesday. ""I feel so sad for my students and for myself.""
JAVIER MILEI CRUSHES ARGENTINE LEFT, BECOMES WORLD'S FIRST LIBERTARIAN HEAD OF STATE
In his drive to reach zero deficit, Milei is slashing spending across Argentina — shuttering ministries, defunding cultural centers, laying off state workers and cutting subsidies. On Monday he had something to show for it, announcing Argentina’s first quarterly fiscal surplus since 2008.

""We are making possible the impossible even with the majority of politics, unions, the media and most economic actors against us,"" he said in a televised address.
Crowds of university students and professors walked out of class Tuesday in a massive display of defiance, joining thousands of demonstrators streaming into the city center. Some privately financed schools closed in solidarity. Protests also gripped other cities in Argentina. ""The university will defend itself!"" students shouted.
""We are trying to show the government it cannot take away our right to education,"" said Santiago Ciraolo, a 32-year-old student in social communication protesting Tuesday. ""Everything is at stake here.""
In a sign of the larger ideological battle at play, members of trade unions and left-wing parties also filled the streets. Describing universities as bastions of socialism where professors indoctrinate their students, Milei has accused his political enemies of fomenting discontent. ""The cognitive dissonance that brainwashing generates in public education is tremendous,"" he said.
Since last July, when the fiscal year began, the 200-year-old University of Buenos Aires, or UBA, has received just 8.9% of its total budget from the state as annual inflation now hovers near 290%. The university says that's barely enough to keep lights on and provide basic services in teaching hospitals that have already cut capacity.
Declaring a financial emergency, UBA warned last week that without a rescue plan, the school would shut down in the coming months, stranding 380,000 students mid-degree. It's a shock for Argentines who consider a free and quality university education a national birthright. UBA has a proud intellectual tradition, having produced five Nobel Prize winners and 17 presidents.
""I've been given access to a future, to opportunities through this university that otherwise my family and many others at our income level could never afford,"" said Alex Vargas, a 24-year-old economics student. ""When you step back, you see how important this is for our society.""
President Milei came to power last December, inheriting an economy in shambles after years of chronic overspending and suffocating international debt. Brandishing a chainsaw during his campaign to symbolize slashing the budget, he repeats a simple catchphrase to compatriots reeling budget cuts and the peso’s 50% devaluation: ""There is no money.""
Overall, Argentina puts about 4.6% of its gross domestic product into education. Critics of the university system say the budget cuts also are an attempt to raise efficiency and increase fiscal transparency. Some want foreign students to start paying dues. Public universities are free not only for Argentines but also for international pupils, drawing legions of students from across Latin America, Spain and further afield.
""Where I'm from, high-quality education is unfortunately a privilege, not a basic right,"" said Sofia Hernandez, a 21-year-old from Bogota, Colombia studying medicine at UBA. ""In Argentina there is a model that I wish more countries could have.""
The government said late Monday it was sending some $24.5 million to public universities and another $12 million to keep medical centers operating. ""The discussion is closed and settled,"" presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni said Tuesday.
University authorities disagreed, saying the promised transfer — which they still have not received — covers just a fraction of what they need. For UBA, that means a 61% annual budget cut, when accounting for inflation.
It also won't help the income of teachers who have seen their salary decline in value more than 35% in the past four months, said Matías Ruiz, UBA's treasury secretary. Staff salaries can be as low as $150 a month. Many teachers juggle multiple jobs just to scrape by, and they wonder if they'll get any salary all next month.
""This has a major impact on our research, on the projects and academic activities we're able to do,"" said Ines Aldao, a 44-year-old literature professor at UBA. ""We've had funding and salary freezes under previous right-wing governments but these cuts are three times worse.""

2 former UN employees charged in conspiracy to sell military equipment in Libya,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Two former United Nations employees in Montreal have been charged with participating in a conspiracy to sell Chinese-made drones and other military equipment in Libya, Canadian police said Tuesday.
RCMP spokesman Sgt. Charles Poirier said the alleged offenses occurred between 2018 and 2021, when the two men were working at the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency headquartered in Montreal.
Police identified the two men as Fathi Ben Ahmed Mhaouek, 61, and Mahmud Mohamed Elsuwaye Sayeh, 37. Poirer said they violated U.N. sanctions related to the Libyan civil war. The sanctions have the force of law in Canada by way of federal regulation.

""What we found is that through some shell companies, they attempted to sell this Chinese military equipment to Libya, which is a direct violation of the regulation,"" Poirier said, adding that the military equipment included large drones that can carry multiple missiles.
Poirier said the regulation prohibits anyone in Canada from supplying military equipment to any of the factions that were fighting in the Libyan civil war, or helping to finance those groups. The alleged conspiracy, he said, would have benefited one of the two main factions in the conflict, which ended in 2020.

""The second part of this scheme was to export Libyan oil to China,"" Poirier said. ""So at the time, the oil fields were under the control of Gen. Khalifa Hifter and the plan was to sell millions of drums of crude oil to China without anyone knowing about it.""
Hifter's self-styled Libyan National Army fought against Libya’s U.N.-backed government and held much of the country’s east during the civil war; he continues to be a powerful figure in that region.
Poirier said Mhaouek, a Canadian citizen, was arrested Tuesday morning at his home in the Montreal suburb of Ste-Catherine, Que., and was scheduled to appear in a Montreal court later in the day.
Mhaouek’s alleged accomplice remains on the run. An Interpol red notice — an alert sent to police around the world — and a Canada-wide warrant have been issued for Sayeh’s arrest.
Poirier said investigators have no indication that military equipment or crude oil ever reached their alleged final destinations, but he said if they had, the two co-conspirators stood to gain several million dollars in commissions.
""The theory behind the motivation is primarily financial,"" he said. However, it would have also benefited China by allowing it to covertly support Hifter's faction and by giving the country prime access to Libyan oil.
Poirier said the investigation began in 2022 after the RCMP received what he described as ""credible intelligence.""
Both men had diplomatic immunity due to their work with the U.N. Their immunity had to be waived by ICAO before the two men could be charged.
The U.N. organization, which sets international aviation standards, has been collaborating with the police investigation.
""There’s no indication that ICAO was aware of the conspiracy until they were approached by us,"" Poirier said.
Police don’t know where Sayeh, a Libyan national, may be.
""He could be in Libya, but with the level of influence and the networking that these men had working at ICAO, he could be anywhere,"" Poirier said.

The UN’s civil aviation agency said in an emailed statement that it is committed to upholding Canadian laws, U.N. standards and its own ethics code.
""ICAO is fully cooperating with the RCMP investigation of the individuals involved in the complaint, who left the organization a number of years ago,"" the agency said. ""ICAO strongly condemns any actions of individuals that are inconsistent with the organization’s values.""","Fox News' ""Antisemitism Exposed"" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.",https://www.foxnews.com/world/2-former-un-employees-charged-conspiracy-sell-military-equipment-libya,2
